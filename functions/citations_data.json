      "snippet": "In this paper, a green learning (GL)-based precoding framework is proposed\nfor simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent\nsurface (STAR-RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO broadcasting systems.\nMotivated by the growing emphasis on environmental sustainability in future 6G\nnetworks, this work adopts a broadcasting transmission architecture for\nscenarios where multiple users share identical information, improving spectral\nefficiency and reducing redundant transmissions and power consumption.\nDifferent from conventional optimization methods, such as block coordinate\ndescent (BCD) that require perfect channel state information (CSI) and\niterative computation, the proposed GL framework operates directly on received\nuplink pilot signals without explicit CSI estimation. Unlike deep learning (DL)\napproaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach\nalso avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more\nlightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with\nsupervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully\nCSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with\nadjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature\nselection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to\njointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral\nefficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point\noperations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude. These advantages make the\nproposed GL approach highly suitable for real-time deployment in energy- and\nhardware-constrained broadcasting scenarios.",

      "snippet": "The scarcity of high-quality, logically sound data is a critical bottleneck\nfor advancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our\nwork confronts this challenge by turning decades of automated theorem proving\nresearch into a scalable data engine. Rather than relying on error-prone LLMs\nor complex proof-assistant syntax like Lean and Isabelle, our framework\nleverages E-prover's saturation capabilities on the vast TPTP axiom library to\nderive a massive, guaranteed-valid corpus of theorems. Our pipeline is\nprincipled and simple: saturate axioms, filter for \"interesting\" theorems, and\ngenerate tasks. With no LLMs in the loop, we eliminate factual errors by\nconstruction. This purely symbolic data is then transformed into three\ndifficulty-controlled challenges: entailment verification, premise selection,\nand proof reconstruction. Our zero-shot experiments on frontier models reveal a\nclear weakness: performance collapses on tasks requiring deep, structural\nreasoning. Our framework provides both the diagnostic tool to measure this gap\nand a scalable source of symbolic training data to address it.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Understanding and modeling individual travel behavior responses is crucial\nfor urban mobility regulation and policy evaluation. The Markov decision\nprocess (MDP) provides a structured framework for dynamic travel behavior\nmodeling at the individual level. However, solving an MDP in this context is\nhighly data-intensive and faces challenges of data quantity, spatial-temporal\ncoverage, and situational diversity. To address these, we propose a\ngroup-effect-enhanced generative adversarial imitation learning (gcGAIL) model\nthat improves the individual behavior modeling efficiency by leveraging shared\nbehavioral patterns among passenger groups. We validate the gcGAIL model using\na public transport fare-discount case study and compare against\nstate-of-the-art benchmarks, including adversarial inverse reinforcement\nlearning (AIRL), baseline GAIL, and conditional GAIL. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that gcGAIL outperforms these methods in learning individual travel\nbehavior responses to incentives over time in terms of accuracy,\ngeneralization, and pattern demonstration efficiency. Notably, gcGAIL is robust\nto spatial variation, data sparsity, and behavioral diversity, maintaining\nstrong performance even with partial expert demonstrations and underrepresented\npassenger groups. The gcGAIL model predicts the individual behavior response at\nany time, providing the basis for personalized incentives to induce sustainable\nbehavior changes (better timing of incentive injections).",

      "snippet": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has achieved remarkable\nsuccess in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models\n(LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods often suffer from exploration\ninefficiency due to mismatches between the training data's difficulty and the\nmodel's capability. LLMs fail to discover viable reasoning paths when problems\nare overly difficult, while learning little new capability when problems are\ntoo simple. In this work, we formalize the impact of problem difficulty by\nquantifying the relationship between loss descent speed and rollout accuracy.\nBuilding on this analysis, we propose SEELE, a novel supervision-aided RLVR\nframework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty to stay within the\nhigh-efficiency region. SEELE augments each training sample by appending a hint\n(part of a full solution) after the original problem. Unlike previous\nhint-based approaches, SEELE deliberately and adaptively adjusts the hint\nlength for each problem to achieve an optimal difficulty. To determine the\noptimal hint length, SEELE employs a multi-round rollout sampling strategy. In\neach round, it fits an item response theory model to the accuracy-hint pairs\ncollected in preceding rounds to predict the required hint length for the next\nround. This instance-level, real-time difficulty adjustment aligns problem\ndifficulty with the evolving model capability, thereby improving exploration\nefficiency. Experimental results show that SEELE outperforms Group Relative\nPolicy Optimization (GRPO) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) by +11.8 and +10.5\npoints, respectively, and surpasses the best previous supervision-aided\napproach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative\napproach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition\nof cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed\nstructures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under\nconstraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded\nhardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating\nbetween nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ\nmonitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In\nthis work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored\nfor real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated\ndataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,\nlabeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast\nand efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we\npropose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable\nconvolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising\naccuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based\nsegmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,\nand pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess\nreal-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%\nand a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than\nMobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,\ndemonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,\nBioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,\nefficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent,\nclosed-loop bioprinting systems.",

      "snippet": "AI-based recommender systems increasingly influence recruitment decisions.\nThus, transparency and responsible adoption in Human Resource Management (HRM)\nare critical. This study examines how HR managers' AI literacy influences their\nsubjective perception and objective understanding of explainable AI (XAI)\nelements in recruiting recommender dashboards. In an online experiment, 410\nGerman-based HR managers compared baseline dashboards to versions enriched with\nthree XAI styles: important features, counterfactuals, and model criteria. Our\nresults show that the dashboards used in practice do not explain AI results and\neven keep AI elements opaque. However, while adding XAI features improves\nsubjective perceptions of helpfulness and trust among users with moderate or\nhigh AI literacy, it does not increase their objective understanding. It may\neven reduce accurate understanding, especially with complex explanations. Only\noverlays of important features significantly aided the interpretations of\nhigh-literacy users. Our findings highlight that the benefits of XAI in\nrecruitment depend on users' AI literacy, emphasizing the need for tailored\nexplanation strategies and targeted literacy training in HRM to ensure fair,\ntransparent, and effective adoption of AI.",

      "snippet": "Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,\nparticularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While\nconvolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,\ntheir limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts\nintegrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,\ncomputationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we\npresent a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for\nreal-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin\nTransformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways\nto preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike\nexisting designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is\nsignificantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's\nability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of\nlabeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning\nmethod that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary\nrepetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the\nentire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary\nsegmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy\nwith substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it\nas a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited\nclinical environments.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "In supply chain management, decision-making often involves balancing multiple\nconflicting objectives, such as cost reduction, service level improvement, and\nenvironmental sustainability. Traditional multi-objective optimization methods,\nsuch as linear programming and evolutionary algorithms, struggle to adapt in\nreal-time to the dynamic nature of supply chains. In this paper, we propose an\napproach that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Objective\nEvolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to address these challenges for dynamic\nmulti-objective optimization under uncertainty. Our method leverages MOEAs to\nsearch the parameter space of policy neural networks, generating a Pareto front\nof policies. This provides decision-makers with a diverse population of\npolicies that can be dynamically switched based on the current system\nobjectives, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in real-time decision-making.\nWe also introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to incorporate\nrisk-sensitive decision-making, enhancing resilience in uncertain environments.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies,\nshowcasing its ability to respond to supply chain dynamics and outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods in an inventory management case study.

Motivated by\nrecent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning\ncan further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving\nReasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based\nthinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to\nguide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained\ndetails, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train\nIRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),\nwhich targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate\nstage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality\ntextual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a\nsubsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed\nlearning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full\nthinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that\nnatively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first\nbuilds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline\nin the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA\nperformance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,\nGenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality\nand fine-grained fidelity.

Outcome-based RL,\nwhich rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields\nsubstantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation\ndiversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is\ncritical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL\npost-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce\neffective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our\nstudy highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation,\nwhere reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and\n(ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a\nlimited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose\noutcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final\noutcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,\nwhich encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch\nexploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time\ndiversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models\ndemonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity\ncollapse.
