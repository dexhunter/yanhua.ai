      "authors": "Shizun Wang, Zhenxiang Jiang, Xingyi Yang, Xinchao Wang",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry\nand camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent\npointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great\nprogress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic\nscenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving\nobjects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the\nreconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages\ntemporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to\n4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of\ncorrespondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train\na dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,\nfacilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from\nthe static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.\nFurthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to\nrecover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the\ncorrespondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling\nfully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework\nachieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across\nmultiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,\nand point tracking.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots\nto complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks\nsuccessfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language\nmodels based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue\nfacing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex\nreal-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning\ncapabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models\nto robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor\ngeneralization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,\na two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,\nsupervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,\nfollowed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial\nunderstanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action\nsequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based\nreward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and\naction constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on\nQwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,\nby 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the\nEmbodiedBench benchmark.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "State Space Models (SSMs) have become the leading alternative to Transformers\nfor sequence modeling. Their primary advantage is efficiency in long-context\nand long-form generation, enabled by fixed-size memory and linear scaling of\ncomputational complexity. We begin this work by showing a simple theoretical\nresult stating that SSMs cannot accurately solve any ``truly long-form''\ngeneration problem (in a sense we formally define), undermining their main\ncompetitive advantage. However, we show that this limitation can be mitigated\nby allowing SSMs interactive access to external tools. In fact, we show that\ngiven the right choice of tool access and problem-dependent training data, SSMs\ncan learn to solve any tractable problem and generalize to arbitrary problem\nlength/complexity (i.e., achieve length generalization). Following our\ntheoretical finding, we demonstrate that tool-augmented SSMs achieve remarkable\nlength generalization on a variety of arithmetic, reasoning, and coding tasks.\nThese findings highlight SSMs as a potential efficient alternative to\nTransformers in interactive tool-based and agentic settings.",

Given recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We\napproach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task\nin which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional\ndemands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To\nsupport this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the\nmachine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical\nsimulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark\nstate-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities\nrequired for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and\ninstruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore\nreinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start\ndataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at\nthe intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.",

      "authors": "Mingxuan Yan, Yuping Wang, Zechun Liu, Jiachen Li",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "To tackle long-horizon tasks, recent hierarchical vision-language-action\n(VLAs) frameworks employ vision-language model (VLM)-based planners to\ndecompose complex manipulation tasks into simpler sub-tasks that low-level\nvisuomotor policies can easily handle. Typically, the VLM planner is finetuned\nto learn to decompose a target task. This finetuning requires target task\ndemonstrations segmented into sub-tasks by either human annotation or heuristic\nrules. However, the heuristic subtasks can deviate significantly from the\ntraining data of the visuomotor policy, which degrades task performance. To\naddress these issues, we propose a Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer\n(RDD) that automatically decomposes demonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning\nthe visual features of the decomposed sub-task intervals with those from the\ntraining data of the low-level visuomotor policies. Our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art sub-task decomposer on both simulation and real-world tasks,\ndemonstrating robustness across diverse settings.

      "authors": "Zhuo-Yang Song",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language\nmodels (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program\ndiscovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where\nto search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally\nstructured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal\ntheory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by\ndomain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and\noutputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a\nfixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all\nreachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a\ncoverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability\ndifficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph\ninduced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable\ninferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory\noffers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their\nsearch spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search\nconstructed by LLMs.",

      "authors": "Wenkai Yang, Weijie Liu, Ruobing Xie, Yiju Guo, Lulu Wu, Saiyong Yang, Yankai Lin",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as\na core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language\nModels (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior\nstudies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into\nthe standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification\ncapabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM\nto sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate\nprompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we\ntheoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of\nself-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true\nreasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,\nwhich is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token\nlog-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last\ntoken and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on\nthis insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token\nSelf-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with\na MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based\nreasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding\ncapabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in\nboth training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm\nderives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of\nthe last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra\ncost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not\nonly improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with\nremarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time\nscaling performance.",

      "authors": "Guoqing Wang, Sunhao Dai, Guangze Ye, Zeyu Gan, Wei Yao, Yong Deng, Xiaofeng Wu, Zhenzhe Ying",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with\nreinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external\nenvironments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that\nrequire multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing\napproaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at\nthe final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in\nmulti-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:\n(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and\nprovide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit\nassignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in\nlong-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy\nOptimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense\nand intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each\ninteraction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the\nground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the\npolicy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior\nprocess-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly\nMonte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the\nmodel's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined\nwith outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive\nexperiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that\nIGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,\nachieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.",

      "authors": "Lizhi Yang, Blake Werner, Massimiliano de Sa Aaron D. Ames",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often\nprioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead\nto catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions\n(CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally\ndeployed \\emph{online} via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior,\nthe fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to\nconservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating\nsafe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs \\emph{in training}. CBF-RL has two key\nattributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety\nconstraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in\ntraining. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be\ndeployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically,\nwe demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned\npolicy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards --\nenabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We\nvalidate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the\nUnitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster\nconvergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid\nrobot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without\na runtime safety filter.",
