      "authors": "Tianda Sun, Dimitar Kazakov",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to perform multi-hop reasoning, i.e., to combine multiple pieces of information into a coherent inference. We introduce KinshipQA, a benchmark designed to probe this capability through reasoning over kinship relations. The central contribution of our work is a generative pipeline that produces, on demand, large-scale, realistic, and culture-specific genealogical data: collections of interconnected family trees that satisfy explicit marriage constraints associated with different kinship systems. This allows task difficulty, cultural assumptions, and relational depth to be systematically controlled and varied. From these genealogies, we derive textual inference tasks that require reasoning over implicit relational chains. We evaluate the resulting benchmark using six state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning both open-source and closed-source models, under a uniform zero-shot protocol with deterministic decoding. Performance is measured using exact-match and set-based metrics. Our results demonstrate that KinshipQA yields a wide spread of outcomes and exposes systematic differences in multi-hop reasoning across models and cultural settings.",

      "snippet": "While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly advanced Computer-Using Agents (CUAs), current frameworks struggle with robustness in long-horizon workflows and generalization in novel domains. These limitations stem from a lack of granular control over historical visual context curation and the absence of visual-aware tutorial retrieval. To bridge these gaps, we introduce OS-Symphony, a holistic framework that comprises an Orchestrator coordinating two key innovations for robust automation: (1) a Reflection-Memory Agent that utilizes milestone-driven long-term memory to enable trajectory-level self-correction, effectively mitigating visual context loss in long-horizon tasks; (2) Versatile Tool Agents featuring a Multimodal Searcher that adopts a SeeAct paradigm to navigate a browser-based sandbox to synthesize live, visually aligned tutorials, thereby resolving fidelity issues in unseen scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OS-Symphony delivers substantial performance gains across varying model scales, establishing new state-of-the-art results on three online benchmarks, notably achieving 65.84% on OSWorld.",

      "authors": "Xiaoheng Wang, Tongxuan Liu, Zi Gong, Xianzhe Dong, Yuting Zeng, Minhan Hu, Weizhe Huang, Jing Li",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of reasoning tasks, including logical and mathematical problem-solving. While prompt-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can enhance LLM reasoning abilities to some extent, they often suffer from a lack of faithfulness, where the derived conclusions may not align with the generated reasoning chain. To address this issue, researchers have explored neuro-symbolic approaches to bolster LLM logical reasoning capabilities. However, existing neuro-symbolic methods still face challenges with information loss during the process. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Iterative Feedback-Driven Neuro-Symbolic (IFDNS), a novel prompt-based method that employs a multi-round feedback mechanism to address LLM limitations in handling complex logical relationships. IFDNS utilizes iterative feedback during the logic extraction phase to accurately extract causal relationship statements and translate them into propositional and logical implication expressions, effectively mitigating information loss issues. Furthermore, IFDNS is orthogonal to existing prompt methods, allowing for seamless integration with various prompting approaches. Empirical evaluations across six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IFDNS in significantly improving the performance of CoT and Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency (CoT-SC). Specifically, IFDNS achieves a +9.40% accuracy boost for CoT on the LogiQA dataset and a +11.70% improvement for CoT-SC on the PrOntoQA dataset.",

      "authors": "Shaoting Zhu, Ziwen Zhuang, Mengjie Zhao, Kun-Ying Lee, Hang Zhao",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Achieving robust humanoid hiking in complex, unstructured environments requires transitioning from reactive proprioception to proactive perception. However, integrating exteroception remains a significant challenge: mapping-based methods suffer from state estimation drift; for instance, LiDAR-based methods do not handle torso jitter well. Existing end-to-end approaches often struggle with scalability and training complexity; specifically, some previous works using virtual obstacles are implemented case-by-case. In this work, we present \\textit{Hiking in the Wild}, a scalable, end-to-end parkour perceptive framework designed for robust humanoid hiking. To ensure safety and training stability, we introduce two key mechanisms: a foothold safety mechanism combining scalable \\textit{Terrain Edge Detection} with \\textit{Foot Volume Points} to prevent catastrophic slippage on edges, and a \\textit{Flat Patch Sampling} strategy that mitigates reward hacking by generating feasible navigation targets. Our approach utilizes a single-stage reinforcement learning scheme, mapping raw depth inputs and proprioception directly to joint actions, without relying on external state estimation. Extensive field experiments on a full-size humanoid demonstrate that our policy enables robust traversal of complex terrains at speeds up to 2.5 m/s. The training and deployment code is open-sourced to facilitate reproducible research and deployment on real robots with minimal hardware modifications.",

      "title": "Studying the Role of Synthetic Data for Machine Learning-based Wireless Networks Traffic Forecasting",
      "authors": "José Pulido, Francesc Wilhelmi, Sergio Fortes, Alfonso Fernández-Durán, Lorenzo Galati Giordano, Raquel Barco",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Synthetic data generation is an appealing tool for augmenting and enriching datasets, playing a crucial role in advancing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Not only does synthetic data help build robust AI/ML datasets cost-effectively, but it also offers privacy-friendly solutions and bypasses the complexities of storing large data volumes. This paper proposes a novel method to generate synthetic data, based on first-order auto-regressive noise statistics, for large-scale Wi-Fi deployments. The approach operates with minimal real data requirements while producing statistically rich traffic patterns that effectively mimic real Access Point (AP) behavior. Experimental results show that ML models trained on synthetic data achieve Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values within 10 to 15 of those obtained using real data when trained on the same APs, while requiring significantly less training data. Moreover, when generalization is required, synthetic-data-trained models improve prediction accuracy by up to 50 percent compared to real-data-trained baselines, thanks to the enhanced variability and diversity of the generated traces. Overall, the proposed method bridges the gap between synthetic data generation and practical Wi-Fi traffic forecasting, providing a scalable, efficient, and real-time solution for modern wireless networks.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "RTL design often relies heavily on ad-hoc testbench creation early in the design cycle. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for RTL code generation, their ability to reason about hardware specifications and generate targeted test plans remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of LLM reasoning capabilities for RTL verification stimuli generation, establishing a two-stage framework that decomposes test plan generation from testbench execution. Our benchmark reveals that state-of-the-art models, including DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.0-Sonnet, achieve only 15.7-21.7% success rates on generating stimuli that pass golden RTL designs. To improve LLM generated stimuli, we develop a comprehensive training methodology combining supervised fine-tuning with a novel reinforcement learning approach, GRPO with State Mutation (GRPO-SMu), which enhances exploration by varying input mutations. Our approach leverages a tree-based branching mutation strategy to construct training data comprising equivalent and mutated trees, moving beyond linear mutation approaches to provide rich learning signals. Training on this curated dataset, our 7B parameter model achieves a 33.3% golden test pass rate and a 13.9% mutation detection rate, representing a 17.6% absolute improvement over baseline and outperforming much larger general-purpose models. These results demonstrate that specialized training methodologies can significantly enhance LLM reasoning capabilities for hardware verification tasks, establishing a foundation for automated sub-unit testing in semiconductor design workflows.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "LLM agents operating over massive, dynamic tool libraries rely on effective retrieval, yet standard single-shot dense retrievers struggle with complex requests. These failures primarily stem from the disconnect between abstract user goals and technical documentation, and the limited capacity of fixed-size embeddings to model combinatorial tool compositions. To address these challenges, we propose TOOLQP, a lightweight framework that models retrieval as iterative query planning. Instead of single-shot matching, TOOLQP decomposes instructions into sub-tasks and dynamically generates queries to interact with the retriever, effectively bridging the semantic gap by targeting the specific sub-tasks required for composition. We train TOOLQP using synthetic query trajectories followed by optimization via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Experiments demonstrate that TOOLQP achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization, robustness across diverse retrievers, and significant improvements in downstream agentic execution.",
