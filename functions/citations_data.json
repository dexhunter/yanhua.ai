      "authors": "Alex Durkin, Jasper Stolte, Matthew Jones, Raghuraman Pitchumani, Bei Li, Christian Michler, Mehmet Mercangöz",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) offers a promising framework for\ndeveloping control strategies in chemical process systems using historical\ndata, without the risks or costs of online experimentation. This work\ninvestigates the application of offline RL to the safe and efficient control of\nan exothermic polymerisation continuous stirred-tank reactor. We introduce a\nGymnasium-compatible simulation environment that captures the reactor's\nnonlinear dynamics, including reaction kinetics, energy balances, and\noperational constraints. The environment supports three industrially relevant\nscenarios: startup, grade change down, and grade change up. It also includes\nreproducible offline datasets generated from proportional-integral controllers\nwith randomised tunings, providing a benchmark for evaluating offline RL\nalgorithms in realistic process control tasks.\n  We assess behaviour cloning and implicit Q-learning as baseline algorithms,\nhighlighting the challenges offline agents face, including steady-state offsets\nand degraded performance near setpoints. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel deployment-time safety layer that performs gradient-based action\ncorrection using input convex neural networks (PICNNs) as learned cost models.\nThe PICNN enables real-time, differentiable correction of policy actions by\ndescending a convex, state-conditioned cost surface, without requiring\nretraining or environment interaction.\n  Experimental results show that offline RL, particularly when combined with\nconvex action correction, can outperform traditional control approaches and\nmaintain stability across all scenarios. These findings demonstrate the\nfeasibility of integrating offline RL with interpretable and safety-aware\ncorrections for high-stakes chemical process control, and lay the groundwork\nfor more reliable data-driven automation in industrial systems.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Forecast reconciliation, an ex-post technique applied to forecasts that must\nsatisfy constraints, has been a prominent topic in the forecasting literature\nover the past two decades. Recently, several efforts have sought to extend\nreconciliation methods to the probabilistic settings. Nevertheless, formal\ntheorems demonstrating error reduction in nonlinear contexts, analogous to\nthose presented in Panagiotelis et al.(2021), are still lacking. This paper\naddresses that gap by establishing such theorems for various classes of\nnonlinear hypersurfaces and vector-valued functions. Specifically, we derive an\nexact analog of Theorem 3.1 from Panagiotelis et al.(2021) for hypersurfaces\nwith constant-sign curvature. Additionally, we provide probabilistic guarantees\nfor the broader case of hypersurfaces with non-constant-sign curvature and for\ngeneral vector-valued functions. To support reproducibility and practical\nadoption, we release a JAX-based Python package, \\emph{to be released upon\npublication}, implementing the presented theorems and reconciliation\nprocedures.",

Consequently,\ntasks such as enforcing spatial access policies remain fragile and manual. We\nfirst propose a unifying representation based on bigraphs, capturing spatial,\nsocial, and communication relationships within a single formalism, with\nuser-facing tools to generate bigraphs from physical environments. Second, we\npresent a hierarchical agent architecture for distributed spatial reasoning,\nwith runtimes for agentic processes to interact the spatial representation, and\na context-aware execution model that scopes reasoning to the smallest viable\nsubspace. Together, these enable private, reliable, and low-latency spatial\nnetworking that can safely interact with agentic workflows.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "The increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software\nengineering has sparked interest in their use for software vulnerability\ndetection. However, the rapid development of this field has resulted in a\nfragmented research landscape, with diverse studies that are difficult to\ncompare due to differences in, e.g., system designs and dataset usage. This\nfragmentation makes it difficult to obtain a clear overview of the\nstate-of-the-art or compare and categorize studies meaningfully. In this work,\nwe present a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of LLM-based\nsoftware vulnerability detection. We analyze 227 studies published between\nJanuary 2020 and June 2025, categorizing them by task formulation, input\nrepresentation, system architecture, and adaptation techniques. Further, we\nanalyze the datasets used, including their characteristics, vulnerability\ncoverage, and diversity. We present a fine-grained taxonomy of vulnerability\ndetection approaches, identify key limitations, and outline actionable future\nresearch opportunities. By providing a structured overview of the field, this\nreview improves transparency and serves as a practical guide for researchers\nand practitioners aiming to conduct more comparable and reproducible research.\nWe publicly release all artifacts and maintain a living repository of LLM-based\nsoftware vulnerability detection studies.",

      "title": "Of Good Demons and Bad Angels: Guaranteeing Safe Control under Finite\n  Precision",
      "authors": "Samuel Teuber, Debasmita Lohar, Bernhard Beckert",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "As neural networks (NNs) become increasingly prevalent in safety-critical\nneural network-controlled cyber-physical systems (NNCSs), formally guaranteeing\ntheir safety becomes crucial. For these systems, safety must be ensured\nthroughout their entire operation, necessitating infinite-time horizon\nverification. To verify the infinite-time horizon safety of NNCSs, recent\napproaches leverage Differential Dynamic Logic (dL). However, these dL-based\nguarantees rely on idealized, real-valued NN semantics and fail to account for\nroundoff errors introduced by finite-precision implementations. This paper\nbridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and real-world implementations\nby incorporating robustness under finite-precision perturbations -- in sensing,\nactuation, and computation -- into the safety verification. We model the\nproblem as a hybrid game between a good Demon, responsible for control actions,\nand a bad Angel, introducing perturbations. This formulation enables formal\nproofs of robustness w.r.t. a given (bounded) perturbation. Leveraging this\nbound, we employ state-of-the-art mixed-precision fixed-point tuners to\nsynthesize sound and efficient implementations, thus providing a complete\nend-to-end solution. We evaluate our approach on case studies from the\nautomotive and aeronautics domains, producing efficient NN implementations with\nrigorous infinite-time horizon safety guarantees.",

      "authors": "Matteo Giacomini, Antonio Huerta",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "A surrogate-based topology optimisation algorithm for linear elastic\nstructures under parametric loads and boundary conditions is proposed. Instead\nof learning the parametric solution of the state (and adjoint) problems or the\noptimisation trajectory as a function of the iterations, the proposed approach\ndevises a surrogate version of the entire optimisation pipeline. First, the\nmethod predicts a quasi-optimal topology for a given problem configuration as a\nsurrogate model of high-fidelity topologies optimised with the homogenisation\nmethod. This is achieved by means of a feed-forward net learning the mapping\nbetween the input parameters characterising the system setup and a latent space\ndetermined by encoder/decoder blocks reducing the dimensionality of the\nparametric topology optimisation problem and reconstructing a high-dimensional\nrepresentation of the topology. Then, the predicted topology is used as an\neducated initial guess for a computationally efficient algorithm penalising the\nintermediate values of the design variable, while enforcing the governing\nequations of the system. This step allows the method to correct potential\nerrors introduced by the surrogate model, eliminate artifacts, and refine the\ndesign in order to produce topologies consistent with the underlying physics.\nDifferent architectures are proposed and the approximation and generalisation\ncapabilities of the resulting models are numerically evaluated. The\nquasi-optimal topologies allow to outperform the high-fidelity optimiser by\nreducing the average number of optimisation iterations by $53\\%$ while\nachieving discrepancies below $4\\%$ in the optimal value of the objective\nfunctional, even in the challenging scenario of testing the model to\nextrapolate beyond the training and validation domain.",

      "snippet": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become an increasingly\npopular paradigm for training large language models (LLMs) and diffusion\nmodels. While existing RLHF training systems have enabled significant progress,\nthey often face challenges in scaling to multi-modal and diffusion workflows\nand adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current approaches may\nencounter limitations in controller scalability, flexible resource placement,\nand efficient orchestration when handling complex RLHF pipelines, especially in\nscenarios involving dynamic sampling or generative reward modeling. In this\npaper, we present \\textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF\ntraining framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a\nparallel controller programming model, enabling flexible and efficient\norchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single\ncentralized controller. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic placement schema that\nadaptively partitions resources and schedules workloads, significantly reducing\nhardware idle time and improving utilization, even under highly variable\ntraining conditions. G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat\nproduct features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its\neffectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our results show that\nG-Core advances the state of the art in RLHF training, providing a solid\nfoundation for future research and deployment of large-scale, human-aligned\nmodels.",
