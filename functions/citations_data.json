      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a novel paradigm in\nquantum artificial intelligence due to its exceptional hardware efficiency. For\npractical applications, pulse-based models must be both expressive and\ntrainable. Previous studies suggest that pulse-based models under dynamic\nsymmetry can be effectively trained, thanks to a favorable loss landscape that\nhas no barren plateaus. However, the resulting uncontrollability may compromise\nexpressivity when the model is inadequately designed. This paper investigates\nthe requirements for pulse-based QML models to be expressive while preserving\ntrainability. We present a necessary condition pertaining to the system's\ninitial state, the measurement observable, and the underlying dynamical\nsymmetry Lie algebra, supported by numerical simulations. Our findings\nestablish a framework for designing practical pulse-based QML models that\nbalance expressivity and trainability.",

      "snippet": "AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems\nbehave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving\nliterature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of\nalignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate,\ntruthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms,\npolitical realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML\nworkflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical\nrealities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in\ncompany leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs\nare globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on\nknowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is\nnot new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based\non user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with\nwhich AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic\nreality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about\nhow context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for\nspatio-temporally aware alignment, rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, is\nincreasingly urgent. This paper reviews key geographic research problems,\nsuggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment\nsensitivity.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit\nbiases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their\npre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted\nquestions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave\nwhen they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a\nmulti-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We\nsystematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction\nusing a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally\nsignificant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We\ntest popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and\nunlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,\nFrench, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs\nare substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North\nthan the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While\nWikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with\nperformance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the\nlanguage in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.\nThese findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation\nframeworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard\nprompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals\nover multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in\ntheir reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/llmbias20q/home.",

      "snippet": "LLM-powered code generation has the potential to revolutionize creative\ncoding endeavors, such as live-coding, by enabling users to focus on structural\nmotifs over syntactic details. In such domains, when prompting an LLM, users\nmay benefit from considering multiple varied code candidates to better realize\ntheir musical intentions. Code generation models, however, struggle to present\nunique and diverse code candidates, with no direct insight into the code's\naudio output. To better establish a relationship between code candidates and\nproduced audio, we investigate the topology of the mapping between code and\naudio embedding spaces. We find that code and audio embeddings do not exhibit a\nsimple linear relationship, but supplement this with a constructed predictive\nmodel that shows an embedding alignment map could be learned. Supplementing the\naim for musically diverse output, we present a model that given code predicts\noutput audio embedding, constructing a code-audio embedding alignment map.",

      "authors": "Xiaoyang Zhang, Zhen Hua, Yakun Ju, Wei Zhou, Jun Liu, Alex C. Kot",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal\nradiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from\nvisible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks.\nHowever, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of\ndeep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can\nalso introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image\nquality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes\nSGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core\nof our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as\nexplicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a\nconditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a\ntwo-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal\nfeatures, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the\npreliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's\ncoarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only\nhas explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of\nthe final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as\nwell as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution\nto the core challenges in image fusion.

      "authors": "Tianchen Fang, Guiru Liu",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated\ndiagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is\nimpeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality\nannotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which\noften miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address\nthese issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal\ncontrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized\npathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of\nour method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively\nintegrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by\na progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal\nalignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we\nconstruct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that\nfeatures extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions.\nExtensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and\nvisual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently\nexceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results\nhighlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and\nposition RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical\nimage understanding.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization\ncapabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance often\nremains suboptimal when directly applied to specific downstream scenarios\nwithout task-specific adaptation. To enhance their utility while preserving\ndata efficiency, recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised\nadaptation methods that do not rely on labeled data. Despite the growing\ninterest in this area, there remains a lack of a unified, task-oriented survey\ndedicated to unsupervised VLM adaptation. To bridge this gap, we present a\ncomprehensive and structured overview of the field. We propose a taxonomy based\non the availability and nature of unlabeled visual data, categorizing existing\napproaches into four key paradigms: Data-Free Transfer (no data), Unsupervised\nDomain Transfer (abundant data), Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (batch data),\nand Online Test-Time Adaptation (streaming data). Within this framework, we\nanalyze core methodologies and adaptation strategies associated with each\nparadigm, aiming to establish a systematic understanding of the field.\nAdditionally, we review representative benchmarks across diverse applications\nand highlight open challenges and promising directions for future research.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Despite the promising potential of large language model (LLM) based\nregister-transfer-level (RTL) code generation, the overall success rate remains\nunsatisfactory. Errors arise from various factors, with limited understanding\nof specific failure causes hindering improvement. To address this, we conduct a\ncomprehensive error analysis and manual categorization. Our findings reveal\nthat most errors stem not from LLM reasoning limitations, but from insufficient\nRTL programming knowledge, poor understanding of circuit concepts, ambiguous\ndesign descriptions, or misinterpretation of complex multimodal inputs.\nLeveraging in-context learning, we propose targeted error correction\ntechniques. Specifically, we construct a domain-specific knowledge base and\nemploy retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to supply necessary RTL knowledge.\nTo mitigate ambiguity errors, we introduce design description rules and\nimplement a rule-checking mechanism. For multimodal misinterpretation, we\nintegrate external tools to convert inputs into LLM-compatible meta-formats.\nFor remaining errors, we adopt an iterative debugging loop (simulation-error\nlocalization-correction). Integrating these techniques into an LLM-based\nframework significantly improves performance. We incorporate these error\ncorrection techniques into a foundational LLM-based RTL code generation\nframework, resulting in significantly improved performance. Experimental\nresults show that our enhanced framework achieves 91.0\\% accuracy on the\nVerilogEval benchmark, surpassing the baseline code generation approach by\n32.7\\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods.",
