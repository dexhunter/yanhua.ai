      "authors": "Yao Lai, Souradip Poddar, Sungyoung Lee, Guojin Chen, Mengkang Hu, Bei Yu, Ping Luo, David Z. Pan",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Despite advances in analog design automation, analog front-end design still\nheavily depends on expert intuition and iterative simulations, underscoring\ncritical gaps in fully automated optimization for performance-critical\napplications. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs)\nhas brought new promise to analog design automation. However, existing work\nremains in its early stages, and holistic joint optimization for practical\nend-to-end solutions remains largely unexplored. We propose AnalogCoder-Pro, a\nunified multimodal LLM-based framework that integrates generative capabilities\nand optimization techniques to jointly explore circuit topologies and optimize\ndevice sizing, automatically generating performance-specific, fully sized\nschematic netlists. AnalogCoder-Pro employs rejection sampling for fine-tuning\nLLMs on high-quality synthesized circuit data and introduces a multimodal\ndiagnosis and repair workflow based on functional specifications and waveform\nimages. By leveraging LLMs to interpret generated circuit netlists,\nAnalogCoder-Pro automates the extraction of critical design parameters and the\nformulation of parameter spaces, establishing an end-to-end workflow for\nsimultaneous topology generation and device sizing optimization. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that these orthogonal approaches significantly improve\nthe success rate of analog circuit design and enhance circuit performance.",

      "authors": "Ming Pok Ng, Junqi Jiang, Gabriel Freedman, Antonio Rago, Francesca Toni",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Leveraging outputs from multiple large language models (LLMs) is emerging as\na method for harnessing their power across a wide range of tasks while\nmitigating their capacity for making errors, e.g., hallucinations. However,\ncurrent approaches to combining insights from multiple LLMs often involve\nunstructured interactions (e.g., free debate), resulting in model generations\nthat are not faithfully justifiable. In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel\nframework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the\nform of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We\nuse a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks\nand semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct\nstructured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable\npathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions,\nproviding a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE\ncan significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models\n(4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior\nmethods for unstructured multi-LLM debates. We thus demonstrate the advantages\nof incorporating formal, argumentative reasoning mechanisms when combining\nmultiple LLM outputs.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Arrhythmia is a common cardiac condition that can precipitate severe\ncomplications without timely intervention. While continuous monitoring is\nessential for timely diagnosis, conventional approaches such as\nelectrocardiogram and wearable devices are constrained by their reliance on\nspecialized medical expertise and patient discomfort from their contact nature.\nExisting contactless monitoring, primarily designed for healthy subjects, face\nsignificant challenges when analyzing reflected signals from arrhythmia\npatients due to disrupted spatial stability and temporal consistency.\n  In this paper, we introduce mCardiacDx, a radar-driven contactless system\nthat accurately analyzes reflected signals and reconstructs heart pulse\nwaveforms for arrhythmia monitoring and diagnosis. The key contributions of our\nwork include a novel precise target localization (PTL) technique that locates\nreflected signals despite spatial disruptions, and an encoder-decoder model\nthat transforms these signals into HPWs, addressing temporal inconsistencies.\nOur evaluation on a large dataset of healthy subjects and arrhythmia patients\nshows that both mCardiacDx and PTL outperform state-of-the-art approach in\narrhythmia monitoring and diagnosis, also demonstrating improved performance in\nhealthy subjects.",

      "snippet": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven impressive\nprogress in omni-modal understanding and generation.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been at the forefront of applied\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) research in a multitude of domains. One such\ndomain is software development, where researchers have pushed the automation of\na number of code tasks through LLM agents. Software development is a complex\necosystem, that stretches far beyond code implementation and well into the\nrealm of code maintenance. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system to\nlocalize bugs in large pre-existing codebases using information retrieval and\nLLMs. Our system introduces a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\napproach, Meta-RAG, where we utilize summaries to condense codebases by an\naverage of 79.8\\%, into a compact, structured, natural language representation.\nWe then use an LLM agent to determine which parts of the codebase are critical\nfor bug resolution, i.e. bug localization. We demonstrate the usefulness of\nMeta-RAG through evaluation with the SWE-bench Lite dataset. Meta-RAG scores\n84.67 % and 53.0 % for file-level and function-level correct localization\nrates, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

      "authors": "Boran Zhao, Haiduo Huang, Qiwei Dang, Wenzhe Zhao, Tian Xia, Pengju Ren",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Training deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has attracted increasing\nattention due to its potential to address challenges related to domain\nadaptation and privacy preservation. However, DNNs typically rely on large\ndatasets for training, which results in substantial energy consumption, making\nthe training in edge devices impractical. Some dataset compression methods have\nbeen proposed to solve this challenge. For instance, the coreset selection and\ndataset distillation reduce the training cost by selecting and generating\nrepresentative samples respectively. Nevertheless, these methods have two\nsignificant defects: (1) The necessary of leveraging a DNN model to evaluate\nthe quality of representative samples, which inevitably introduces inductive\nbias of DNN, resulting in a severe generalization issue; (2) All training\nimages require multiple accesses to the DDR via long-distance PCB connections,\nleading to substantial energy overhead. To address these issues, inspired by\nthe nonlinear manifold stationary of the human brain, we firstly propose a\nDNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, called DE-SNE, to improve the\ngeneralization issue. Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory\ncomputing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images\nneed to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR\nenergy consumption. As a result, we build a novel expedited DNN training system\nwith a more efficient in-place Near-Memory Sampling characteristic for edge\ndevices, dubbed NMS. As far as we know, our NMS is the first DNN-free\nnear-memory sampling technique that can effectively alleviate generalization\nissues and significantly reduce DDR energy caused by dataset access. The\nexperimental results show that our NMS outperforms the current state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) approaches, namely DQ, DQAS, and NeSSA, in model accuracy.",
