      "snippet": "Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed\ntomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and cancer\ntreatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised\npretraining can produce reliably accurate segmentation from in-distribution\n(ID) data but degrade when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. We\naddress this challenge with RF-Deep, a random forest classifier that utilizes\ndeep features from a pretrained transformer encoder of the segmentation model\nto detect OOD scans and enhance segmentation reliability. The segmentation\nmodel comprises a Swin Transformer encoder, pretrained with masked image\nmodeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans covering cancerous and\nnon-cancerous conditions, with a convolution decoder, trained to segment lung\ncancers in 317 3D scans. Independent testing was performed on 603 3D CT public\ndatasets that included one ID dataset and four OOD datasets comprising chest\nCTs with pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19, and abdominal CTs with kidney\ncancers and healthy volunteers. RF-Deep detected OOD cases with a FPR95 of\n18.26%, 27.66%, and less than 0.1% on PE, COVID-19, and abdominal CTs,\nconsistently outperforming established OOD approaches.

We have\ndeveloped a small, purpose-built model checking algorithm which generates plans\nin situ based on \"core\" knowledge and attention as found in biological agents.\nThis is achieved in real-time using no pre-computed data on a low-powered\ndevice. Our approach is based on chaining temporary control systems which are\nspawned to counteract disturbances in the local environment that disrupt an\nautonomous agent from its preferred action (or resting state). A novel\ndiscretization of 2D LiDAR data sensitive to bounded variations in the local\nenvironment is used. Multi-step planning using model checking by forward\ndepth-first search is applied to cul-de-sac and playground scenarios. Both\nempirical results and informal proofs of two fundamental properties of our\napproach demonstrate that model checking can be used to create efficient\nmulti-step plans for local obstacle avoidance, improving on the performance of\na reactive agent which can only plan one step.

Existing pre-deployment robustness\nassessment methods typically suffer from significant trade-offs between\ncomputational cost and measurement precision, limiting their practical utility.\nTo address these limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative\nanalysis of existing robustness definitions and associated assessment\nmethodologies. We propose tower robustness to evaluate robustness, which is a\nnovel, practical metric based on hypothesis testing to quantitatively evaluate\nprobabilistic robustness, enabling more rigorous and efficient pre-deployment\nassessments. Our extensive comparative evaluation illustrates the advantages\nand applicability of our proposed approach, thereby advancing the systematic\nunderstanding and enhancement of model robustness in safety-critical deep\nlearning applications.",

In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework\nthat assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured,\nfeedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency\ngraph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides\nminimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and\nfulfill target constraints. This dynamic protocol enables fine-grained\ndiagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic\nweaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a\nbenchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and\nevaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert\nannotation.

In this paper, we dive deeper into one of such\nbenchmarks: associative recall (AR), which has been shown to correlate well\nwith language modeling performance, and inspect in detail the effects of\nscaling and optimization issues in recently proposed token mixing strategies.\nWe first demonstrate that, unlike standard transformers, the choice of learning\nrate plays a critical role in the performance of modern recurrent models: an\nissue that can severely affect reported performance in previous works and\nsuggests further research is needed to stabilize training. Next, we show that\nrecurrent and attention-based models exhibit contrasting benefits when scaling\nin width as opposed to depth, with attention being notably unable to solve AR\nwhen limited to a single layer. We then further inspect 1-layer transformers,\nrevealing that despite their poor performance, their training dynamics\nsurprisingly resemble the formation of induction heads, a phenomenon previously\nobserved only in their 2-layer counterparts. Finally, through architectural\nablations, we study how components affects Transformer and Mamba's performance\nand optimization stability.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce GitTaskBench, a\nbenchmark designed to systematically assess this capability via 54 realistic\ntasks across 7 modalities and 7 domains. Each task pairs a relevant repository\nwith an automated, human-curated evaluation harness specifying practical\nsuccess criteria. Beyond measuring execution and task success, we also propose\nthe alpha-value metric to quantify the economic benefit of agent performance,\nwhich integrates task success rates, token cost, and average developer\nsalaries. Experiments across three state-of-the-art agent frameworks with\nmultiple advanced LLMs show that leveraging code repositories for complex task\nsolving remains challenging: even the best-performing system, OpenHands+Claude\n3.7, solves only 48.15% of tasks. Error analysis attributes over half of\nfailures to seemingly mundane yet critical steps like environment setup and\ndependency resolution, highlighting the need for more robust workflow\nmanagement and increased timeout preparedness.

      "snippet": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their\nenormous computational demands severely limit deployment and real-time\nperformance. Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however,\nattaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs\nat arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to\nthe limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and\ninflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a\ncomprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM.\nFirstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for\nefficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more\nconducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication\n(MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and\nreassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision\nand optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a\nmemory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs\nfast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce\nmemory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that\ndynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for\nvarying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM\narchitectures and precision settings. In LLM inference, APT-LLM achieves up to\na 3.99$\\times$ speedup compared to FP16 baselines and a 2.16$\\times$ speedup\nover NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 acceleration on RTX 3090.

      "authors": "Paul Garnier, Jonathan Viquerat, Elie Hachem",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical\nsimulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of\nphysical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training\ndomain (\\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains\nuncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their\ntraditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in\nconjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and\ntheoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node\ngraphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat\nequation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN\nachieves a loss $\\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme\nwith an error of $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show\nthat the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of\nthe standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an\nunsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a\nresidual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no\naccess to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by\nconsidering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN\nusing the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order\ncorrection term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the\nclassic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm\nin scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be\nactive contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.",
