      "title": "AnaFlow: Agentic LLM-based Workflow for Reasoning-Driven Explainable and\n  Sample-Efficient Analog Circuit Sizing",
      "authors": "Mohsen Ahmadzadeh, Kaichang Chen, Georges Gielen",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Analog/mixed-signal circuits are key for interfacing electronics with the\nphysical world. Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process,\nresulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of\nAI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to\nautomate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical\nbottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of\nexplainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of\nthe tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for\nsample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs\na multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based\nagents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design\ngoals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the\ntarget goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation\nstrategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency.\nThe AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity\nand is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from\npure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system\nlearns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate\nconvergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog\ndesign space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents\nserve as transparent design assistants.",

      "authors": "Md Ahasanul Arafath, Abhijit Kumar Ghosh, Md Rony Ahmed, Sabrin Afroz, Minhazul Hosen, Md Hasan Moon, Md Tanzim Reza, Md Ashad Alam",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) grading is a critical prognostic factor but remains\nhampered by inter-observer variability and the privacy constraints of\nmulti-institutional data sharing. While deep learning offers a path to\nautomation, centralized training models conflict with data governance\nregulations and neglect the diagnostic importance of multi-scale analysis. In\nthis work, we propose a scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning (FL)\nframework for CRC histopathological grading that integrates multi-scale feature\nlearning within a distributed training paradigm. Our approach employs a\ndual-stream ResNetRS50 backbone to concurrently capture fine-grained nuclear\ndetail and broader tissue-level context. This architecture is integrated into a\nrobust FL system stabilized using FedProx to mitigate client drift across\nheterogeneous data distributions from multiple hospitals. Extensive evaluation\non the CRC-HGD dataset demonstrates that our framework achieves an overall\naccuracy of 83.5%, outperforming a comparable centralized model (81.6%).\nCrucially, the system excels in identifying the most aggressive Grade III\ntumors with a high recall of 87.5%, a key clinical priority to prevent\ndangerous false negatives. Performance further improves with higher\nmagnification, reaching 88.0% accuracy at 40x. These results validate that our\nfederated multi-scale approach not only preserves patient privacy but also\nenhances model performance and generalization. The proposed modular pipeline,\nwith built-in preprocessing, checkpointing, and error handling, establishes a\nfoundational step toward deployable, privacy-aware clinical AI for digital\npathology.",
