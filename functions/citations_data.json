      "title": "On the Faithfulness of Visual Thinking: Measurement and Enhancement",
      "authors": "Zujing Liu, Junwen Pan, Qi She, Yuan Gao, Guisong Xia",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text\nmultimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning\n(RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is\noften inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of\nfaithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to\nthe RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved\nvision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information\ninto its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual\ninformation. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by\nmeasuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts\nare intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged\nunder visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention,\nindicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze\nvisual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that\nquantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability\nand sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current\nMCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component\nCause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate\nsufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of\nleading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free\nand compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical\nresults demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness\nacross a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks.

      "snippet": "The behaviour of neural network components must be proven correct before\ndeployment in safety-critical systems. Unfortunately, existing neural network\nverification techniques cannot certify the absence of faults at the software\nlevel. In this paper, we show how to specify and verify that neural networks\nare safe, by explicitly reasoning about their floating-point implementation. In\ndoing so, we construct NeuroCodeBench 2.0, a benchmark comprising 912 neural\nnetwork verification examples that cover activation functions, common layers,\nand full neural networks of up to 170K parameters. Our verification suite is\nwritten in plain C and is compatible with the format of the International\nCompetition on Software Verification (SV-COMP). Thanks to it, we can conduct\nthe first rigorous evaluation of eight state-of-the-art software verifiers on\nneural network code. The results show that existing automated verification\ntools can correctly solve an average of 11% of our benchmark, while producing\naround 3% incorrect verdicts.

This terminological ambiguity fosters mismatched user\nexpectations, accountability challenges, and barriers to industry growth.\nInspired by the SAE J3016 standard for driving automation, this survey\nintroduces the first systematic hierarchical taxonomy for data agents,\ncomprising six levels that delineate and trace progressive shifts in autonomy,\nfrom manual operations (L0) to a vision of generative, fully autonomous data\nagents (L5), thereby clarifying capability boundaries and responsibility\nallocation. Through this lens, we offer a structured review of existing\nresearch arranged by increasing autonomy, encompassing specialized data agents\nfor data management, preparation, and analysis, alongside emerging efforts\ntoward versatile, comprehensive systems with enhanced autonomy. We further\nanalyze critical evolutionary leaps and technical gaps for advancing data\nagents, especially the ongoing L2-to-L3 transition, where data agents evolve\nfrom procedural execution to autonomous orchestration.

      "snippet": "Predictive benchmarking, the evaluation of machine learning models based on\npredictive performance and competitive ranking, is a central epistemic practice\nin machine learning research and an increasingly prominent method for\nscientific inquiry. Yet, benchmark scores alone provide at best measurements of\nmodel performance relative to an evaluation dataset and a concrete learning\nproblem. Drawing substantial scientific inferences from the results, say about\ntheoretical tasks like image classification, requires additional assumptions\nabout the theoretical structure of the learning problems, evaluation functions,\nand data distributions. We make these assumptions explicit by developing\nconditions of construct validity inspired by psychological measurement theory.\nWe examine these assumptions in practice through three case studies, each\nexemplifying a typical intended inference: measuring engineering progress in\ncomputer vision with ImageNet; evaluating policy-relevant weather predictions\nwith WeatherBench; and examining limitations of the predictability of life\nevents with the Fragile Families Challenge. Our framework clarifies the\nconditions under which benchmark scores can support diverse scientific claims,\nbringing predictive benchmarking into perspective as an epistemological\npractice and a key site of conceptual and theoretical reasoning in machine\nlearning.",

      "snippet": "Eigenvalue problems are among the most important topics in many scientific\ndisciplines. With the recent surge and development of machine learning, neural\neigenvalue methods have attracted significant attention as a forward pass of\ninference requires only a tiny fraction of the computation time compared to\ntraditional solvers. However, a key limitation is the requirement for large\namounts of labeled data in training, including operators and their eigenvalues.\nTo tackle this limitation, we propose a novel method, named Sorting Chebyshev\nSubspace Filter (SCSF), which significantly accelerates eigenvalue data\ngeneration by leveraging similarities between operators -- a factor overlooked\nby existing methods. Specifically, SCSF employs truncated fast Fourier\ntransform sorting to group operators with similar eigenvalue distributions and\nconstructs a Chebyshev subspace filter that leverages eigenpairs from\npreviously solved problems to assist in solving subsequent ones, reducing\nredundant computations. To the best of our knowledge, SCSF is the first method\nto accelerate eigenvalue data generation. Experimental results show that SCSF\nachieves up to a $3.5\\times$ speedup compared to various numerical solvers.",

By\nfocusing on the development of self-supervised learning techniques and domain\nadaptation methods, this research aims to circumvent these limitations,\npresenting a novel approach to enhance the utility and efficacy of deep\nlearning in medical imaging.\n  Central to this thesis is the development of the Medformer, an innovative\nneural network architecture designed for multitask learning and deep domain\nadaptation. This model is adept at pre-training on diverse medical image\ndatasets, handling varying sizes and modalities, and is equipped with a dynamic\ninput-output adaptation mechanism. This enables efficient processing and\nintegration of a wide range of medical image types, from 2D X-rays to complex\n3D MRIs, thus mitigating the dependency on large labeled datasets.\n  Further, the thesis explores the current state of self-supervised learning in\nmedical imaging.

This approach is validated through\nrigorous experimentation, including the use of the MedMNIST dataset,\ndemonstrating the model's proficiency in learning generalized features\napplicable to various downstream tasks.\n  In summary, this thesis contributes to the advancement of medical image\nanalysis by offering a scalable, adaptable framework that reduces reliance on\nlabeled data.

      "snippet": "Since their introduction, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been\nsuccessfully applied across several domains, with physics-informed machine\nlearning (PIML) emerging as one of the areas where they have thrived. In the\nPIML setting, Chebyshev-based physics-informed KANs (cPIKANs) have become the\nstandard due to their computational efficiency. However, like their multilayer\nperceptron-based counterparts, cPIKANs face significant challenges when scaled\nto depth, leading to training instabilities that limit their applicability to\nseveral PDE problems. To address this, we propose a basis-agnostic, Glorot-like\ninitialization scheme that preserves activation variance and yields substantial\nimprovements in stability and accuracy over the default initialization of\ncPIKANs. Inspired by the PirateNet architecture, we further introduce\nResidual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs), designed to mitigate divergence in\ndeep cPIKANs where initialization alone is not sufficient. Through empirical\ntests and information bottleneck analysis, we show that RGA KANs successfully\ntraverse all training phases, unlike baseline cPIKANs, which stagnate in the\ndiffusion phase in specific PDE settings. Evaluations on seven standard forward\nPDE benchmarks under a fixed training pipeline with adaptive components\ndemonstrate that RGA KANs consistently outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and\nPirateNets - often by several orders of magnitude - while remaining stable in\nsettings where the others diverge.",

BBOPlace-Bench integrates a wide variety of\nexisting BBO algorithms, including simulated annealing (SA), evolutionary\nalgorithms (EAs), and Bayesian optimization (BO). Experimental results show\nthat the problem formulations of mask-guided optimization and hyperparameter\noptimization exhibit superior performance than the sequence pair problem\nformulation, while EAs demonstrate better overall performance than SA and BO,\nespecially in high-dimensional search spaces, and also achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance compared to the mainstream chip placement methods.

BlocKOA is specifically\ndesigned for IC applications. Initially, we use the block Krylov algorithm\nbased on the structure of the heat equation to quickly obtain a few basic\nsolutions. Then we combine them to get numerous temperature distributions that\nsatisfy the physical constraints. Finally, we apply heat operators on these\nfunctions to determine the heat source distributions, efficiently generating\nprecise data points. Theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of\nBlocKOA is one order lower than the existing method.
