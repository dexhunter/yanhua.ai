      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce plausible but poorly-calibrated\nanswers, limiting their reliability on reasoning-intensive tasks. We present\nReinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF), a post-training stage that\nuses the model's own confidence as an intrinsic reward, mimicking how humans\nlearn in the absence of external feedback. After a frozen LLM generates several\nchain-of-thought solutions, we define and compute the confidence of each final\nanswer span and rank the traces accordingly. These synthetic preferences are\nthen used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization,\nsimilar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally\ncurated rewards.\n  RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates --\nrestoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step\nreasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and\nmultiple-choice question answering.\n  By turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms\nreinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and\ndata-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further\nresearch in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training.",

      "snippet": "Retrosynthesis planning remains a central challenge in molecular discovery\ndue to the vast and complex chemical reaction space. While traditional\ntemplate-based methods offer tractability, they suffer from poor scalability\nand limited generalization, and template-free generative approaches risk\ngenerating invalid reactions. In this work, we propose TempRe, a generative\nframework that reformulates template-based approaches as sequence generation,\nenabling scalable, flexible, and chemically plausible retrosynthesis. We\nevaluated TempRe across single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis tasks,\ndemonstrating its superiority over both template classification and\nSMILES-based generation methods. On the PaRoutes multi-step benchmark, TempRe\nachieves strong top-k route accuracy. Furthermore, we extend TempRe to direct\nmulti-step synthesis route generation, providing a lightweight and efficient\nalternative to conventional single-step and search-based approaches. These\nresults highlight the potential of template generative modeling as a powerful\nparadigm in computer-aided synthesis planning.",

We investigate bounded fitting for the description logic ALC and its\nsyntactic fragments. We show that the underlying size-restricted fitting\nproblem is NP-complete for all studied fragments, even in the special case of a\nsingle positive and a single negative example. By design, bounded fitting comes\nwith probabilistic guarantees in Valiant's PAC learning framework. In contrast,\nwe show that other classes of algorithms for learning ALC concepts do not\nprovide such guarantees. Finally, we present an implementation of bounded\nfitting in ALC and its fragments based on a SAT solver. We discuss\noptimizations and compare our implementation to other concept learning tools.",

To address this gap,\nwe introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in\nmulti-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users\nwho start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally,\nrequiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with\ntools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a\nsignificant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For\ninstance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only\n20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer\nthan 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results\nhighlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task\nexecutors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive\nenvironment to measure and advance this critical capability.",

      "snippet": "We introduce new methods of staining and locking computer vision models, to\nprotect their owners' intellectual property. Staining, also known as\nwatermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to\nidentify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret\ntrigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms\ncan be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning\nor retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their\nworst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly\nmodifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the\n(unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small\n`trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental\nresults showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical\nperformance on a variety of computer vision models.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Post-training quantization (PTQ) improves efficiency but struggles with\nlimited calibration data, especially under privacy constraints. Data-free\nquantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using\ngenerative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and\ntext-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ\nalgorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and\nthe generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored.\nWithout investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous\nprompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues\nsuch as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose\n\\textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses\nmultiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust\nsynthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves\noptimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through\ngradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ.

      "snippet": "We introduce a unified machine-learning framework designed to conveniently\ntackle the temporal evolution of alloy microstructures under the influence of\nan elastic field. This approach allows for the simultaneous extraction of\nelastic parameters from a short trajectory and for the prediction of further\nmicrostructure evolution under their influence. This is demonstrated by\nfocusing on spinodal decomposition in the presence of a lattice mismatch eta,\nand by carrying out an extensive comparison between the ground-truth evolution\nsupplied by phase field simulations and the predictions of suitable\nconvolutional recurrent neural network architectures. The two tasks may then be\nperformed subsequently into a cascade framework. Under a wide spectrum of\nmisfit conditions, the here-presented cascade model accurately predicts eta and\nthe full corresponding microstructure evolution, also when approaching critical\nconditions for spinodal decomposition. Scalability to larger computational\ndomain sizes and mild extrapolation errors in time (for time sequences five\ntimes longer than the sampled ones during training) are demonstrated. The\nproposed framework is general and can be applied beyond the specific,\nprototypical system considered here as an example. Intriguingly, experimental\nvideos could be used to infer unknown external parameters, prior to simulating\nfurther temporal evolution.",

While games such as Go and Atari have led to many\nbreakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied\napplications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing\ncomplexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce\nAssistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in\nassistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for\nsignificant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of\nopen-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\\times$ faster when\nvectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax\nconceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human\npatient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents\nagainst which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities\ncan be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular\ncontinuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and\nestablish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for\nassistive robotics.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "We propose a novel segmentation-based explainable artificial intelligence\n(XAI) method for neural networks working on point cloud classification. As one\nbuilding block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to\nintroduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an\nexponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making\nprocess of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work\nfocuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An\nimportant aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their\nability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This\nallows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions\nbased on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate\nmeaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point\ncloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and\nlaptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate\nexplanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to\nintroduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency\nmaps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism\nproposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence\nthe output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods,\nthe segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily\ninterpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over\nother methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We\ncompare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate\nexplanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs\nusing our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating\nmeaningful explanations.",
