      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (neuro-symbolic AI) excels in logical\nanalysis and reasoning. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a promising\nbrain-inspired computational model, is integral to neuro-symbolic AI. Various\nHDC models have been proposed to represent class-instance and class-class\nrelations, but when representing the more complex class-subclass relation,\nwhere multiple objects associate different levels of classes and subclasses,\nthey face challenges for factorization, a crucial task for neuro-symbolic AI\nsystems. In this article, we propose FactorHD, a novel HDC model capable of\nrepresenting and factorizing the complex class-subclass relation efficiently.\nFactorHD features a symbolic encoding method that embeds an extra memorization\nclause, preserving more information for multiple objects. In addition, it\nemploys an efficient factorization algorithm that selectively eliminates\nredundant classes by identifying the memorization clause of the target class.\nSuch model significantly enhances computing efficiency and accuracy in\nrepresenting and factorizing multiple objects with class-subclass relation,\novercoming limitations of existing HDC models such as \"superposition\ncatastrophe\" and \"the problem of 2\". Evaluations show that FactorHD achieves\napproximately 5667x speedup at a representation size of 10^9 compared to\nexisting HDC models. When integrated with the ResNet-18 neural network,\nFactorHD achieves 92.48% factorization accuracy on the Cifar-10 dataset.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has raised concerns\nregarding its trustworthiness, especially in terms of interpretability and\nrobustness. Tree-based models like Random Forest and XGBoost excel in\ninterpretability and accuracy for tabular data, but scaling them remains\ncomputationally expensive due to poor data locality and high data dependence.\nPrevious efforts to accelerate these models with analog content addressable\nmemory (CAM) have struggled, due to the fact that the difficult-to-implement\nsharp decision boundaries are highly susceptible to device variations, which\nleads to poor hardware performance and vulnerability to adversarial attacks.\nThis work presents a novel hardware-software co-design approach using $MoS_2$\nFlash-based analog CAM with inherent soft boundaries, enabling efficient\ninference with soft tree-based models. Our soft tree model inference\nexperiments on $MoS_2$ analog CAM arrays show this method achieves exceptional\nrobustness against device variation and adversarial attacks while achieving\nstate-of-the-art accuracy. Specifically, our fabricated analog CAM arrays\nachieve $96\\%$ accuracy on Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) database,\nwhile maintaining decision explainability. Our experimentally calibrated model\nvalidated only a $0.6\\%$ accuracy drop on the MNIST dataset under $10\\%$ device\nthreshold variation, compared to a $45.3\\%$ drop for traditional decision\ntrees. This work paves the way for specialized hardware that enhances AI's\ntrustworthiness and efficiency.",

      "title": "Can We Predict Alignment Before Models Finish Thinking? Towards\n  Monitoring Misaligned Reasoning Models",
      "authors": "Yik Siu Chan, Zheng-Xin Yong, Stephen H. Bach",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs)\nbefore producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces\nadditional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the\nCoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to\npredict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring\napproaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text\nclassifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple\nlinear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all\ntext-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or\nunsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers,\nwhile model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive\nsignal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning\ncompletes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT\nsegments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety\nbenchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety\nmonitoring and early intervention during generation.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Beyond hallucinations, another problem in program synthesis using LLMs is\nambiguity in user intent. We illustrate the ambiguity problem in a networking\ncontext for LLM-based incremental configuration synthesis of route-maps and\nACLs. These structures frequently overlap in header space, making the relative\npriority of actions impossible for the LLM to infer without user interaction.\nMeasurements in a large cloud identify complex ACLs with 100's of overlaps,\nshowing ambiguity is a real problem. We propose a prototype system, Clarify,\nwhich uses an LLM augmented with a new module called a Disambiguator that helps\nelicit user intent. On a small synthetic workload, Clarify incrementally\nsynthesizes routing policies after disambiguation and then verifies them. Our\ntreatment of ambiguities is useful more generally when the intent of updates\ncan be correctly synthesized by LLMs, but their integration is ambiguous and\ncan lead to different global behaviors.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks\nand domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm\nof Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like\nRegister-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However,\ndespite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a\ndearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware\ndescription languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the\nperformance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization\nusing various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,\nan in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally\nequivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these\nmodels across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their\nsuitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose\nChain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of\nLLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves\ngenerating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem\nstatement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These\nsteps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or\ncode) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the\nstandard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This\nmethod not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization\nbut also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs\nfor VHDL.",
