      "title": "Inverse Reinforcement Learning Meets Large Language Model Post-Training:\n  Basics, Advances, and Opportunities",
      "authors": "Hao Sun, Mihaela van der Schaar",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), alignment has emerged as a\nfundamental yet challenging problem in the pursuit of more reliable,\ncontrollable, and capable machine intelligence. The recent success of reasoning\nmodels and conversational AI systems has underscored the critical role of\nreinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing these systems, driving increased\nresearch interest at the intersection of RL and LLM alignment. This paper\nprovides a comprehensive review of recent advances in LLM alignment through the\nlens of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), emphasizing the distinctions\nbetween RL techniques employed in LLM alignment and those in conventional RL\ntasks. In particular, we highlight the necessity of constructing neural reward\nmodels from human data and discuss the formal and practical implications of\nthis paradigm shift. We begin by introducing fundamental concepts in RL to\nprovide a foundation for readers unfamiliar with the field. We then examine\nrecent advances in this research agenda, discussing key challenges and\nopportunities in conducting IRL for LLM alignment. Beyond methodological\nconsiderations, we explore practical aspects, including datasets, benchmarks,\nevaluation metrics, infrastructure, and computationally efficient training and\ninference techniques. Finally, we draw insights from the literature on\nsparse-reward RL to identify open questions and potential research directions.\nBy synthesizing findings from diverse studies, we aim to provide a structured\nand critical overview of the field, highlight unresolved challenges, and\noutline promising future directions for improving LLM alignment through RL and\nIRL techniques.",

      "title": "Learning to Reject Low-Quality Explanations via User Feedback",
      "authors": "Luca Stradiotti, Dario Pesenti, Stefano Teso, Jesse Davis",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Machine Learning predictors are increasingly being employed in high-stakes\napplications such as credit scoring. Explanations help users unpack the reasons\nbehind their predictions, but are not always \"high quality''. That is,\nend-users may have difficulty interpreting or believing them, which can\ncomplicate trust assessment and downstream decision-making. We argue that\nclassifiers should have the option to refuse handling inputs whose predictions\ncannot be explained properly and introduce a framework for learning to reject\nlow-quality explanations (LtX) in which predictors are equipped with a rejector\nthat evaluates the quality of explanations. In this problem setting, the key\nchallenges are how to properly define and assess explanation quality and how to\ndesign a suitable rejector. Focusing on popular attribution techniques, we\nintroduce ULER (User-centric Low-quality Explanation Rejector), which learns a\nsimple rejector from human ratings and per-feature relevance judgments to\nmirror human judgments of explanation quality. Our experiments show that ULER\noutperforms both state-of-the-art and explanation-aware learning to reject\nstrategies at LtX on eight classification and regression benchmarks and on a\nnew human-annotated dataset, which we will publicly release to support future\nresearch.",

      "authors": "Xiangyu Dong, Haoran Zhao, Jiang Gao, Haozhou Li, Xiaoguang Ma, Yaoming Zhou, Fuhai Chen, Juan Liu",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to\nemerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent\ngeneralization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.\nHowever, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning\nabilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and\nthus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,\nwe drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and\nproposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the\nability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it\nwas the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework\nwas proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a\nhierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into\nreusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to\nretrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection\nmodule to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the\nSE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen\nenvironments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%\nover current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,\nrespectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with\nincreasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a\nself-evolving agent framework for VLN.",

      "authors": "Senqiao Yang, Junyi Li, Xin Lai, Bei Yu, Hengshuang Zhao, Jiaya Jia",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved\nperformance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often\nsignificantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world\nscenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the\nperformance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models\nstill perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4\nresolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with\ndifferent resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,\nnamely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides\nwhether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output\na special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing\nEfficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or\nthresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by\ncase. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding\ncapability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens\non simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge\nstrategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully\ndesign a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and\nreasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available\nat https://github.com/dvlab-research/VisionThink.",
