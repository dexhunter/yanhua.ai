      "snippet": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a\npowerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language\nmodels, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions:\nDepth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances\nconsumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and\nreveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights\nsamples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances\nthat are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth\nneglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which\nre-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby\nincreasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically,\nnaively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts\nPass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra\ninference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of\nexploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training\ndata can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch\nsize and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over\nmultiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance.\nLarge-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued\nexploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which\naugments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K\nand Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across\ndepth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the\nreasoning power of RLVR.",

To address this, we\npioneer \"pointing\" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate\nrepresentation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge\nhigh-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We\nintroduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed\nfor embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and\ngeneral visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale\ndataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing\ncapabilities.

Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot\ngeneralization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5%\nacross 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning,\nrepresenting a 62% improvement over strong baselines.

      "authors": "Rehan Raza, Guanjin Wang, Kevin Wong, Hamid Laga, Marco Fisichella",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local\nInterpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the\ninterpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their\nbehavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent\nrandomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability\nissues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data\nscarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples\nthat deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may\nfail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original\nmodel. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer\nLearning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and\nstability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance\ntransfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances\nfrom a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target\ndomain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into\nclusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random\nperturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the\nsource cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These\nare then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To\ndefine a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based\nencoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the\ncombined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these\nweighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for\nexplanation purposes.",

We\npresent a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to\ngenerate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters\n(Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends\ncountdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model \"writes while\ncounting.\" We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens),\nXSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH\nequal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps\nfrom below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt,\nsurpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality\nis preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved\nthrough prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to\ntraining- or decoding-based methods.",

POML employs\ncomponent-based markup for logical structure (roles, tasks, examples),\nspecialized tags for seamless data integration, and a CSS-like styling system\nto decouple content from presentation, reducing formatting sensitivity. It\nincludes templating for dynamic prompts and a comprehensive developer toolkit\n(IDE support, SDKs) to improve version control and collaboration.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial\ndomain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and\ncomplicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited\nby their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing\nto robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we\npropose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)\nframework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates\nin two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and\nadversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,\nwe use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for\ncapturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical\ndepartment categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the\nsubsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert\nagents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,\nwe employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence\nscores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial\nvalidation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on\nthree public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC\noutperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior\ndiagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC\nachieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the\nbest-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the\neffectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent\ncomplementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.",
