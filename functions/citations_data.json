      "authors": "Eric Seng, Hugh O'Connor, Adam Boyce, Josh J. Bailey, Anton van Beek",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Generative machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for design\nrepresentation and exploration. However, its application is often constrained\nby the need for large datasets of existing designs and the lack of\ninterpretability about what features drive optimality. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing training\ndatasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be\nleveraged for interpretable design. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) we\npresent a systematic framework for generating archetypes with internally\nhomogeneous but mutually heterogeneous inputs that can be used to generate a\ntraining dataset, and (ii) we show how integrating generative models with\nBayesian optimization can enhance the interpretability of the latent space of\nadmissible designs. These findings are validated by using the framework to\ndesign a flow battery manifold, demonstrating that it effectively captures the\nspace of feasible designs, including novel configurations while enabling\nefficient exploration. This work broadens the applicability of generative\nmachine-learning models in system designs by enhancing quality and reliability.",

      "snippet": "Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new\nscientific discoveries. Recently, \\textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented\ngenerated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements\nin this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage\n(reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle\ndifferences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final\nfactual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant\nprogress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In\nthis work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark\n(SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning\nfive scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in\nterms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency,\nwe develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy\nContexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI),\nand Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely\nused rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into\ntheir relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge,\nSciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate\nrerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance\nfor their future development.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "In this paper, we present a novel neural architecture for channel estimation\n(CE) in 5G and beyond, the Recurrent Equivariant UERS Estimation Network\n(ReQuestNet). It incorporates several practical considerations in wireless\ncommunication systems, such as ability to handle variable number of resource\nblock (RB), dynamic number of transmit layers, physical resource block groups\n(PRGs) bundling size (BS), demodulation reference signal (DMRS) patterns with a\nsingle unified model, thereby, drastically simplifying the CE pipeline. Besides\nit addresses several limitations of the legacy linear MMSE solutions, for\nexample, by being independent of other reference signals and particularly by\njointly processing MIMO layers and differently precoded channels with unknown\nprecoding at the receiver. ReQuestNet comprises of two sub-units, CoarseNet\nfollowed by RefinementNet. CoarseNet performs per PRG, per transmit-receive\n(Tx-Rx) stream channel estimation, while RefinementNet refines the CoarseNet\nchannel estimate by incorporating correlations across differently precoded\nPRGs, and correlation across multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel\nspatial dimensions (cross-MIMO). Simulation results demonstrate that ReQuestNet\nsignificantly outperforms genie minimum mean squared error (MMSE) CE across a\nwide range of channel conditions, delay-Doppler profiles, achieving up to 10dB\ngain at high SNRs. Notably, ReQuestNet generalizes effectively to unseen\nchannel profiles, efficiently exploiting inter-PRG and cross-MIMO correlations\nunder dynamic PRG BS and varying transmit layer allocations.",

      "authors": "Shady Agwa, Yihan Pan, Georgios Papandroulidakis, Themis Prodromakis",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Artificial Intelligence models are currently driven by a significant\nup-scaling of their complexity, with massive matrix multiplication workloads\nrepresenting the major computational bottleneck. In-memory computing\narchitectures are proposed to avoid the Von Neumann bottleneck. However, both\ndigital/binary-based and analogue in-memory computing architectures suffer from\nvarious limitations, which significantly degrade the performance and energy\nefficiency gains. This work proposes OISMA, a novel in-memory computing\narchitecture that utilizes the computational simplicity of a quasi-stochastic\ncomputing domain (Bent-Pyramid system), while keeping the same efficiency,\nscalability, and productivity of digital memories. OISMA converts normal memory\nread operations into in-situ stochastic multiplication operations with a\nnegligible cost. An accumulation periphery then accumulates the output\nmultiplication bitstreams, achieving the matrix multiplication functionality.\nExtensive matrix multiplication benchmarking was conducted to analyze the\naccuracy of the Bent-Pyramid system, using matrix dimensions ranging from 4x4\nto 512x512. The accuracy results show a significant decrease in the average\nrelative Frobenius error, from 9.42% (for 4x4) to 1.81% (for 512x512), compared\nto 64-bit double precision floating-point format. A 1T1R OISMA array of 4 KB\ncapacity was implemented using a commercial 180nm technology node and in-house\nRRAM technology. At 50 MHz, OISMA achieves 0.891 TOPS/W and 3.98 GOPS/mm2 for\nenergy and area efficiency, respectively, occupying an effective computing area\nof 0.804241 mm2. Scaling OISMA from 180nm to 22nm technology shows a\nsignificant improvement of two orders of magnitude in energy efficiency and one\norder of magnitude in area efficiency, compared to dense matrix multiplication\nin-memory computing architectures.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its\nreal-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered\nby shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional\napproaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information\nfrom preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by\ncomplex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need\nfor recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative\nby reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large\nset of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically\noffline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel\nintegrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape\ncompletion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously\nacquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from\nultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based\nshape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time\nvisualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable\nnavigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,\nreproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our\napproach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy\nand evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.\nAdditionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a\nvolunteer scan.",

By\nremoving the conventional GAN discriminator, we streamline EGGCodec's training\nprocess without compromising efficiency, incurring only negligible performance\ndegradation. Trained on a widely used EGG-inclusive dataset, extensive\nevaluations demonstrate that EGGCodec outperforms state-of-the-art F0\nextraction schemes, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) from 14.14 Hz to 13.69\nHz, and improving voicing decision error (VDE) by 38.2\\%.

To address these\nresearch gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic\nquestionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to\nmodel LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through\nthe empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic\nmarkers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the\nevaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine\ntheir influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that\nmodelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable,\nparticularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Recent work on enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models\n(LLMs) has introduced explicit length control as a means of constraining\ncomputational cost while preserving accuracy. However, existing approaches rely\non fixed-length training budgets, which do not take advantage of the natural\nprogression from exploration to compression during learning. In this work, we\npropose a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning using\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method starts with generous\ntoken budgets and gradually tightens them over training, encouraging models to\nfirst discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more\nconcise reasoning traces. We augment GRPO with a reward function that balances\nthree signals: task correctness (via verifier feedback), length efficiency, and\nformatting adherence (via structural tags). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500,\nSVAMP, College Math, and GSM+ demonstrate that curriculum-based training\nconsistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines at the same final budget,\nachieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency. We\nfurther ablate the impact of reward weighting and decay schedule design,\nshowing that progressive constraint serves as a powerful inductive bias for\ntraining efficient reasoning models.
