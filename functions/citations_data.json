      "snippet": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the predominant architecture for learning\nover graphs. As with any machine learning model, and important issue is the\ndetection of adversarial attacks, where an adversary can change the output with\na small perturbation of the input. Techniques for solving the adversarial\nrobustness problem - determining whether such an attack exists - were\noriginally developed for image classification, but there are variants for many\nother machine learning architectures. In the case of graph learning, the attack\nmodel usually considers changes to the graph structure in addition to or\ninstead of the numerical features of the input, and the state of the art\ntechniques in the area proceed via reduction to constraint solving, working on\ntop of powerful solvers, e.g. for mixed integer programming. We show that it is\npossible to improve on the state of the art in structural robustness by\nreplacing the use of powerful solvers by calls to efficient partial solvers,\nwhich run in polynomial time but may be incomplete. We evaluate our tool\nRobLight on a diverse set of GNN variants and datasets.",

Diverse embedding models emerge from differences in\narchitectures, loss functions, input modalities and datasets, each capturing\nunique aspects of the input. Multi-teacher distillation leverages this\ndiversity to enrich representations but often remains tailored to specific\ntasks. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic framework based on a\n``majority vote\" objective function. We demonstrate that this function is\nbounded by the mutual information between student and teachers' embeddings,\nleading to a task-agnostic distillation loss that eliminates dependence on\ntask-specific labels or prior knowledge. Our evaluations across text, vision\nmodels, and molecular modeling show that our method effectively leverages\nteacher diversity, resulting in representations enabling better performance for\na wide range of downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or\nregression.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "The reasoning large language model (RLLM) has been proven competitive in\nsolving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, coding, compared to\ngeneral LLM. However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains\nunexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in\nreal-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a\ncomprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on\ncomparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal\nthat there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1)\nsignificant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive\nrunning time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether\nexisting inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main\ntakeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can\nimprove service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while\nprefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving\nperformance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world\nworkload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical\nresults of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned\nwith our main findings regarding RLLM serving. We hope our work can provide the\nresearch community and industry with insights to advance RLLM inference\nserving.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "The adoption of long context windows has become a standard feature in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), as extended contexts significantly enhance their\ncapacity for complex reasoning and broaden their applicability across diverse\nscenarios. Dynamic sparse attention is a promising approach for reducing the\ncomputational cost of long-context. However, efficiently training LLMs with\ndynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts-especially in distributed\nsettings-remains a significant challenge, due in large part to worker- and\nstep-level imbalance. This paper introduces MTraining, a novel distributed\nmethodology leveraging dynamic sparse attention to enable efficient training\nfor LLMs with ultra-long contexts. Specifically, MTraining integrates three key\ncomponents: a dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention,\nand hierarchical sparse ring attention. These components are designed to\nsynergistically address the computational imbalance and communication overheads\ninherent in dynamic sparse attention mechanisms during the training of models\nwith extensive context lengths. We demonstrate the efficacy of MTraining by\ntraining Qwen2.5-3B, successfully expanding its context window from 32K to 512K\ntokens on a cluster of 32 A100 GPUs. Our evaluations on a comprehensive suite\nof downstream tasks, including RULER, PG-19, InfiniteBench, and Needle In A\nHaystack, reveal that MTraining achieves up to a 6x higher training throughput\nwhile preserving model accuracy.

      "snippet": "Tuberculosis remains a critical global health issue, particularly in\nresource-limited and remote areas. Early detection is vital for treatment, yet\nthe lack of skilled radiologists underscores the need for artificial\nintelligence (AI)-driven screening tools. Developing reliable AI models is\nchallenging due to the necessity for large, high-quality datasets, which are\ncostly to obtain. To tackle this, we propose a teacher--student framework which\nenhances both disease and symptom detection on chest X-rays by integrating two\nsupervised heads and a self-supervised head. Our model achieves an accuracy of\n98.85% for distinguishing between COVID-19, tuberculosis, and normal cases, and\na macro-F1 score of 90.09% for multilabel symptom detection, significantly\noutperforming baselines. The explainability assessments also show the model\nbases its predictions on relevant anatomical features, demonstrating promise\nfor deployment in clinical screening and triage settings.",

      "authors": "Chengwen Du, Tao Chen",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "To mitigate unfair and unethical discrimination over sensitive features\n(e.g., gender, age, or race), fairness testing plays an integral role in\nengineering systems that leverage AI models to handle tabular data. A key\nchallenge therein is how to effectively reveal fairness bugs under an\nintractable sample size using perturbation. Much current work has been focusing\non designing the test sample generators, ignoring the valuable knowledge about\ndata characteristics that can help guide the perturbation and hence limiting\ntheir full potential. In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing\na generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT.\nThrough causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most\ndirectly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive\ncounterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such a\ncausal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guide\na test sample generator. Unlike existing generator-level work, CausalFT serves\nas a higher-level framework that can be paired with diverse base generators.\nExtensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that CausalFT can considerably\nimprove arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of the\ncases with acceptable extra runtime overhead. Compared with a state-of-the-art\napproach that ranks the non-sensitive features solely based on correlation,\nCausalFT performs significantly better on 64% cases while being much more\nefficient. Further, CausalFT can better improve bias resilience in nearly all\ncases.",

      "snippet": "Accurate annual average daily traffic (AADT) data are vital for transport\nplanning and infrastructure management. However, automatic traffic detectors\nacross national road networks often provide incomplete coverage, leading to\nunderrepresentation of minor roads. While recent machine learning advances have\nimproved AADT estimation at unmeasured locations, most models produce only\npoint predictions and overlook estimation uncertainty. This study addresses\nthat gap by introducing an interval prediction approach that explicitly\nquantifies predictive uncertainty. We integrate a Quantile Random Forest model\nwith Principal Component Analysis to generate AADT prediction intervals,\nproviding plausible traffic ranges bounded by estimated minima and maxima.\nUsing data from over 2,000 minor roads in England and Wales, and evaluated with\nspecialized interval metrics, the proposed method achieves an interval coverage\nprobability of 88.22%, a normalized average width of 0.23, and a Winkler Score\nof 7,468.47. By combining machine learning with spatial and high-dimensional\nanalysis, this framework enhances both the accuracy and interpretability of\nAADT estimation, supporting more robust and informed transport planning.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Object-goal navigation (ObjNav) tasks an agent with navigating to the\nlocation of a specific object in an unseen environment. Embodied agents\nequipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation\nmaps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily\nrely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small\nLLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to\nlimited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which\nprevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt\nintroduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency\non local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device\nefficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better\nunderstand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to\nprune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we\npropose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to\nefficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on\nHM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time\nlatency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner.

Yet existing approaches struggle\nto strike the right balance: methods that tightly enforce safety often cripple\ntask performance, while those that prioritize reward leave safety constraints\nfrequently violated, producing diffuse cost landscapes that flatten gradients\nand stall policy improvement. We introduce the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC), a\nnovel approach that integrates uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into\ncritic training. By concentrating conservatism in uncertain and costly regions\nwhile preserving sharp gradients in safe areas, USC enables policies to achieve\neffective reward-safety trade-offs. Extensive experiments show that USC reduces\nsafety violations by approximately 40% while maintaining competitive or higher\nrewards, and reduces the error between predicted and true cost gradients by\napproximately 83%, breaking the prevailing trade-off between safety and\nperformance and paving the way for scalable safe RL.",
