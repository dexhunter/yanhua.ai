      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Solving inverse and optimization problems over solutions of nonlinear partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) on complex spatial domains is a long-standing\nchallenge. Here we introduce a method that parameterizes the solution using\nspectral bases on arbitrary spatiotemporal domains, whereby the basis is\ndefined on a hyperrectangle containing the true domain. We find the\ncoefficients of the basis expansion by solving an optimization problem whereby\nboth the equations, the boundary conditions and any optimization targets are\nenforced by a loss function, building on a key idea from Physics-Informed\nNeural Networks (PINNs). Since the representation of the function natively has\nexponential convergence, so does the solution of the optimization problem, as\nlong as it can be solved efficiently. We find empirically that the optimization\nprotocols developed for machine learning find solutions with exponential\nconvergence on a wide range of equations. The method naturally allows for the\nincorporation of data assimilation by including additional terms in the loss\nfunction, and for the efficient solution of optimization problems over the PDE\nsolutions.",

      "authors": "Harm Lameris, Shree Harsha Bokkahalli Satish, Joakim Gustafson, Éva Székely",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Recent advances in speech foundation models (SFMs) have enabled the direct\nprocessing of spoken language from raw audio, bypassing intermediate textual\nrepresentations. This capability allows SFMs to be exposed to, and potentially\nrespond to, rich paralinguistic variations embedded in the input speech signal.\nOne under-explored dimension of paralinguistic variation is voice quality,\nencompassing phonation types such as creaky and breathy voice. These phonation\ntypes are known to influence how listeners infer affective state, stance and\nsocial meaning in speech. Existing benchmarks for speech understanding largely\nrely on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) formats, which are prone to\nfailure and therefore unreliable in capturing the nuanced ways paralinguistic\nfeatures influence model behaviour. In this paper, we probe SFMs through\nopen-ended generation tasks and speech emotion recognition, evaluating whether\nmodel behaviours are consistent across different phonation inputs. We introduce\na new parallel dataset featuring synthesized modifications to voice quality,\ndesigned to evaluate SFM responses to creaky and breathy voice. Our work\nprovides the first examination of SFM sensitivity to these particular\nnon-lexical aspects of speech perception.",

In zero-shot evaluations on the\nGift-Eval benchmark, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance,\noutperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the vast\nmajority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than\nexisting baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference.\nWe open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code,\nproviding a reproducible foundation for future research.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "While many problems in machine learning focus on learning mappings between\nfinite-dimensional spaces, scientific applications require approximating\nmappings between function spaces, i.e., operators. We study the problem of\nlearning collections of operators and provide both theoretical and empirical\nadvances. We distinguish between two regimes: (i) multiple operator learning,\nwhere a single network represents a continuum of operators parameterized by a\nparametric function, and (ii) learning several distinct single operators, where\neach operator is learned independently. For the multiple operator case, we\nintroduce two new architectures, $\\mathrm{MNO}$ and $\\mathrm{MONet}$, and\nestablish universal approximation results in three settings: continuous,\nintegrable, or Lipschitz operators. For the latter, we further derive explicit\nscaling laws that quantify how the network size must grow to achieve a target\napproximation accuracy. For learning several single operators, we develop a\nframework for balancing architectural complexity across subnetworks and show\nhow approximation order determines computational efficiency. Empirical\nexperiments on parametric PDE benchmarks confirm the strong expressive power\nand efficiency of the proposed architectures. Overall, this work establishes a\nunified theoretical and practical foundation for scalable neural operator\nlearning across multiple operators.",

      "authors": "Víctor Medina, Giovanny A. Cuervo-Londoño, Javier Sánchez",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "The accurate prediction of oceanographic variables is crucial for\nunderstanding climate change, managing marine resources, and optimizing\nmaritime activities. Traditional ocean forecasting relies on numerical models;\nhowever, these approaches face limitations in terms of computational cost and\nscalability. In this study, we adapt Aurora, a foundational deep learning model\noriginally designed for atmospheric forecasting, to predict sea surface\ntemperature (SST) in the Canary Upwelling System. By fine-tuning this model\nwith high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data, we demonstrate its ability\nto capture complex spatiotemporal patterns while reducing computational\ndemands. Our methodology involves a staged fine-tuning process, incorporating\nlatitude-weighted error metrics and optimizing hyperparameters for efficient\nlearning. The experimental results show that the model achieves a low RMSE of\n0.119K, maintaining high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC $\\approx\n0.997$). The model successfully reproduces large-scale SST structures but faces\nchallenges in capturing finer details in coastal regions. This work contributes\nto the field of data-driven ocean forecasting by demonstrating the feasibility\nof using deep learning models pre-trained in different domains for oceanic\napplications. Future improvements include integrating additional oceanographic\nvariables, increasing spatial resolution, and exploring physics-informed neural\nnetworks to enhance interpretability and understanding. These advancements can\nimprove climate modeling and ocean prediction accuracy, supporting\ndecision-making in environmental and economic sectors.",

      "authors": "Gabrielle O'Brien, Antonio Pedro Santos Alves, Sebastian Baltes, Grischa Liebel, Mircea Lungu, Marcos Kalinowski",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Programming assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) have become\nwidely available, with conversational assistants like ChatGPT proving\nparticularly accessible to less experienced programmers. However, the varied\ncapabilities of these tools across model versions and the mixed availability of\nextensions that enable web search, code execution, or retrieval-augmented\ngeneration create opportunities for user misconceptions about what systems can\nand cannot do. Such misconceptions may lead to over-reliance, unproductive\npractices, or insufficient quality control in LLM-assisted programming. Here,\nwe aim to characterize misconceptions that users of conversational LLM-based\nassistants may have in programming contexts. Using a two-phase approach, we\nfirst brainstorm and catalog user misconceptions that may occur, and then\nconduct a qualitative analysis to examine whether these conceptual issues\nsurface in naturalistic Python-programming conversations with an LLM-based\nchatbot drawn from an openly available dataset. Indeed, we see evidence that\nsome users have misplaced expectations about the availability of LLM-based\nchatbot features like web access, code execution, or non-text output\ngeneration. We also see potential evidence for deeper conceptual issues around\nthe scope of information required to debug, validate, and optimize programs.\nOur findings reinforce the need for designing LLM-based tools that more clearly\ncommunicate their programming capabilities to users.",

      "authors": "Mohamad Abou Ali, Fadi Dornaika",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Agentic AI represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, but\nits rapid advancement has led to a fragmented understanding, often conflating\nmodern neural systems with outdated symbolic models -- a practice known as\nconceptual retrofitting. This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing\na novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two\ndistinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and\npersistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation\nand prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of\n90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around\nthis framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and\narchitectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific\nimplementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how\napplication constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific\nethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation\nstrategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:\nsymbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while\nneural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).\nFurthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant\ndeficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for\nhybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic\nroadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one\nparadigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both\nadaptable and reliable. This work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to\nguide future research, development, and policy toward robust and trustworthy\nhybrid intelligent systems.",

      "snippet": "Deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,\nyet getting a global concept-level understanding of how they function remains a\nkey challenge. Many post-hoc concept-based approaches have been introduced to\nunderstand their workings, yet they are not always faithful to the model.\nFurther, they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns, such\nas class-specificity, small spatial extent, or alignment to human expectations.\nIn this work, we put emphasis on the faithfulness of such concept-based\nexplanations and propose a new model with model-inherent mechanistic\nconcept-explanations. Our concepts are shared across classes and, from any\nlayer, their contribution to the logit and their input-visualization can be\nfaithfully traced. We also leverage foundation models to propose a new\nconcept-consistency metric, C$^2$-Score, that can be used to evaluate\nconcept-based methods. We show that, compared to prior work, our concepts are\nquantitatively more consistent and users find our concepts to be more\ninterpretable, all while retaining competitive ImageNet performance.",

      "snippet": "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI)-native wireless communication is\nfundamentally reshaping the design paradigm of next-generation (NextG) systems,\nwhere intelligent air interfaces are expected to operate adaptively and\nefficiently in highly dynamic environments. Conventional orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiplexing (OFDM) systems rely heavily on pilots and the cyclic\nprefix (CP), resulting in significant overhead and reduced spectral efficiency.\nTo address these limitations, we propose an adaptive end-to-end (E2E)\ntransceiver architecture tailored for pilot-free and CP-free wireless systems.\nThe architecture combines AI-driven constellation shaping and a neural receiver\nthrough joint training. To enhance robustness against mismatched or\ntime-varying channel conditions, we introduce a lightweight channel adapter\n(CA) module, which enables rapid adaptation with minimal computational overhead\nby updating only the CA parameters. Additionally, we present a framework that\nis scalable to multiple modulation orders within a unified model, significantly\nreducing model storage requirements. Moreover, to tackle the high\npeak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) inherent to OFDM, we incorporate constrained\nE2E training, achieving compliance with PAPR targets without additional\ntransmission overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed\nframework delivers superior bit error rate (BER), throughput, and resilience\nacross diverse channel scenarios, highlighting its potential for AI-native\nNextG.",
