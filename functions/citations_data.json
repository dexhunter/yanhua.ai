      "title": "Sequential Enumeration in Large Language Models",
      "authors": "Kuinan Hou, Marco Zorzi, Alberto Testolin",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Reliably counting and generating sequences of items remain a significant challenge for neural networks, including Large Language Models (LLMs). Indeed, although this capability is readily handled by rule-based symbolic systems based on serial computation, learning to systematically deploy counting procedures is difficult for neural models, which should acquire these skills through learning. Previous research has demonstrated that recurrent architectures can only approximately track and enumerate sequences of events, and it remains unclear whether modern deep learning systems, including LLMs, can deploy systematic counting procedures over sequences of discrete symbols. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the sequential enumeration abilities of five state-of-the-art LLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning models. We probe LLMs in sequential naming and production tasks involving lists of letters and words, adopting a variety of prompting instructions to explore the role of chain-of-thought in the spontaneous emerging of counting strategies. We also evaluate open-source models with the same architecture but increasing size to see whether the mastering of counting principles follows scaling laws, and we analyze the embedding dynamics during sequential enumeration to investigate the emergent encoding of numerosity. We find that some LLMs are indeed capable of deploying counting procedures when explicitly prompted to do so, but none of them spontaneously engage in counting when simply asked to enumerate the number of items in a sequence. Our results suggest that, despite their impressive emergent abilities, LLMs cannot yet robustly and systematically deploy counting procedures, highlighting a persistent gap between neural and symbolic approaches to compositional generalization.",

      "authors": "NaHyeon Park, Namin An, Kunhee Kim, Soyeon Yoon, Jiahao Huo, Hyunjung Shim",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large vision-language model (LVLM) based text-to-image (T2I) systems have become the dominant paradigm in image generation, yet whether they amplify social biases remains insufficiently understood. In this paper, we show that LVLM-based models produce markedly more socially biased images than non-LVLM-based models. We introduce a 1,024 prompt benchmark spanning four levels of linguistic complexity and evaluate demographic bias across multiple attributes in a systematic manner. Our analysis identifies system prompts, the predefined instructions guiding LVLMs, as a primary driver of biased behavior. Through decoded intermediate representations, token-probability diagnostics, and embedding-association analyses, we reveal how system prompts encode demographic priors that propagate into image synthesis. To this end, we propose FairPro, a training-free meta-prompting framework that enables LVLMs to self-audit and construct fairness-aware system prompts at test time. Experiments on two LVLM-based T2I models, SANA and Qwen-Image, show that FairPro substantially reduces demographic bias while preserving text-image alignment. We believe our findings provide deeper insight into the central role of system prompts in bias propagation and offer a practical, deployable approach for building more socially responsible T2I systems.",

      "title": "Environment-Aware Channel Inference via Cross-Modal Flow: From Multimodal Sensing to Wireless Channels",
      "authors": "Guangming Liang, Mingjie Yang, Dongzhu Liu, Paul Henderson, Lajos Hanzo",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Accurate channel state information (CSI) underpins reliable and efficient wireless communication. However, acquiring CSI via pilot estimation incurs substantial overhead, especially in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating in high-Doppler environments. By leveraging the growing availability of environmental sensing data, this treatise investigates pilot-free channel inference that estimates complete CSI directly from multimodal observations, including camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and GPS coordinates. In contrast to prior studies that rely on predefined channel models, we develop a data-driven framework that formulates the sensing-to-channel mapping as a cross-modal flow matching problem. The framework fuses multimodal features into a latent distribution within the channel domain, and learns a velocity field that continuously transforms the latent distribution toward the channel distribution. To make this formulation tractable and efficient, we reformulate the problem as an equivalent conditional flow matching objective and incorporate a modality alignment loss, while adopting low-latency inference mechanisms to enable real-time CSI estimation. In experiments, we build a procedural data generator based on Sionna and Blender to support realistic modeling of sensing scenes and wireless propagation. System-level evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over pilot- and sensing-based benchmarks in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency for the downstream beamforming task.",

Our work tests this by evaluating Small Language Models coupled with a curated agentic AI framework on NVIDIA's Comprehensive Verilog Design Problems(CVDP) benchmark. Results show that agentic workflows: through task decomposition, iterative feedback, and correction - not only unlock near-LLM performance at a fraction of the cost but also create learning opportunities for agents, paving the way for efficient, adaptive solutions in complex design tasks.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "We introduce Small Building Model (SBM), a Transformer-based architecture for layout synthesis in Building Information Modeling (BIM) scenes. We address the question of how to tokenize buildings by unifying heterogeneous feature sets of architectural elements into sequences while preserving compositional structure. Such feature sets are represented as a sparse attribute-feature matrix that captures room properties. We then design a unified embedding module that learns joint representations of categorical and possibly correlated continuous feature groups. Lastly, we train a single Transformer backbone in two modes: an encoder-only pathway that yields high-fidelity room embeddings, and an encoder-decoder pipeline for autoregressive prediction of room entities, referred to as Data-Driven Entity Prediction (DDEP). Experiments across retrieval and generative layout synthesis show that SBM learns compact room embeddings that reliably cluster by type and topology, enabling strong semantic retrieval. In DDEP mode, SBM produces functionally sound layouts, with fewer collisions and boundary violations and improved navigability.",
