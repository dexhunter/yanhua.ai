Unlike prior\napproaches trained on healthy adult speech, ChiReSSD adapts to the voices of\nchildren with speech sound disorders (SSD), with particular emphasis on pitch\nand prosody. We evaluate our method on the STAR dataset and report substantial\nimprovements in lexical accuracy and speaker identity preservation.\nFurthermore, we automatically predict the phonetic content in the original and\nreconstructed pairs, where the proportion of corrected consonants is comparable\nto the percentage of correct consonants (PCC), a clinical speech assessment\nmetric. Our experiments show Pearson correlation of 0.63 between automatic and\nhuman expert annotations, highlighting the potential to reduce the manual\ntranscription burden. In addition, experiments on the TORGO dataset demonstrate\neffective generalization for reconstructing adult dysarthric speech. Our\nresults indicate that disentangled, style-based TTS reconstruction can provide\nidentity-preserving speech across diverse clinical populations.",

The development of\npredictive models that identify interventions effective at mitigating storm\nimpacts has considerable potential to reduce these adverse outcomes. In this\nstudy, we use an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approach for optimizing\nintervention schemes that improve resilience to coastal flooding. We combine\nthree different AI models to optimize the selection of intervention types,\nsites, and scales in order to minimize the expected cost of flooding damage in\na given region, including the cost of installing and maintaining interventions.\nOur approach combines data-driven generation of storm surge fields, surrogate\nmodeling of intervention impacts, and the solving of a continuous-armed bandit\nproblem. We applied this methodology to optimize the selection of sea wall and\noyster reef interventions near Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB) in Florida, an area\nthat was catastrophically impacted by Hurricane Michael.

We propose a four-part taxonomy\n(parametric, contextual, external, procedural/episodic) and a memory quadruple\n(location, persistence, write/access path, controllability). We link mechanism,\nevaluation, and governance via the chain write -> read -> inhibit/update. To\navoid distorted comparisons across heterogeneous setups, we adopt a\nthree-setting protocol (parametric only, offline retrieval, online retrieval)\nthat decouples capability from information availability on the same data and\ntimeline. On this basis we build a layered evaluation: parametric (closed-book\nrecall, edit differential, memorization/privacy), contextual (position curves\nand the mid-sequence drop), external (answer correctness vs snippet\nattribution/faithfulness), and procedural/episodic (cross-session consistency\nand timeline replay, E MARS+). The framework integrates temporal governance and\nleakage auditing (freshness hits, outdated answers, refusal slices) and\nuncertainty reporting via inter-rater agreement plus paired tests with\nmultiple-comparison correction. For updating and forgetting, we present DMM\nGov: coordinating DAPT/TAPT, PEFT, model editing (ROME, MEND, MEMIT, SERAC),\nand RAG to form an auditable loop covering admission thresholds, rollout,\nmonitoring, rollback, and change audits, with specs for timeliness, conflict\nhandling, and long-horizon consistency.

This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense\nreasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities\ncoexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded\ncommonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate\nlightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and\ndemonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised\nfine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12\nculture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by\n10\\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that\nout-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or\nsurpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural\ncommonsense transferability beyond the Arab world. These findings demonstrate\nthat efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offer a promising\napproach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings.",

      "snippet": "RLVR has enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)\nacross various tasks. However, GRPO, a representative RLVR algorithm, suffers\nfrom a critical limitation: when all responses within a group are either\nentirely correct or entirely incorrect, the model fails to learn from these\nhomogeneous responses. This is particularly problematic for homogeneously\nincorrect groups, where GRPO's advantage function yields a value of zero,\nleading to null gradients and the loss of valuable learning signals. To\novercome this issue, we propose NGRPO (Negative-enhanced Group Relative Policy\nOptimization), an algorithm designed to convert homogeneous errors into robust\nlearning signals. First, NGRPO introduces Advantage Calibration. This mechanism\nhypothesizes the existence of a virtual maximum-reward sample during advantage\ncalculation, thereby altering the mean and variance of rewards within a group\nand ensuring that the advantages for homogeneously incorrect samples are no\nlonger zero. Second, NGRPO employs Asymmetric Clipping, which relaxes the\nupdate magnitude for positive samples while imposing stricter constraints on\nthat of negative samples. This serves to stabilize the exploration pressure\nintroduced by the advantage calibration. Our experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-7B\ndemonstrate that NGRPO significantly outperforms baselines such as PPO, GRPO,\nDAPO, and PSR-NSR on mathematical benchmarks including MATH500, AMC23, and\nAIME2025. These results validate NGRPO's ability to learn from homogeneous\nerrors, leading to stable and substantial improvements in mathematical\nreasoning.

To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data\n(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast\nto prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,\nRLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to\nlearn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement\nlearning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively.

We\ntherefore conduct a systematic evaluation across ten LRMs on math and\nscientific reasoning. Contrary to the \"longer-is-better\" narrative, we find\nthat both naive CoT lengthening and increased review are associated with\n*lower* accuracy.\n  As CoT unfolds step by step, token-level metrics can conflate verbosity with\nprocess quality. We introduce a graph view of CoT to extract structure and\nidentify a single statistic-the *Failed-Step Fraction (FSF)*, the fraction of\nsteps in abandoned branches-that consistently outpredicts length and review\nratio for correctness across models. To probe causality, we design two\ninterventions. First, we rank candidate CoTs by each metric at test time, where\nFSF yields the largest pass@1 gains; second, we edit CoTs to remove failed\nbranches, which significantly improves accuracy, indicating that failed\nbranches bias subsequent reasoning.
