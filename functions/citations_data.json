      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "SRAM Processing-in-Memory (PIM) has emerged as the most promising\nimplementation for high-performance PIM, delivering superior computing density,\nenergy efficiency, and computational precision. However, the pursuit of higher\nperformance necessitates more complex circuit designs and increased operating\nfrequencies, which exacerbate IR-drop issues. Severe IR-drop can significantly\ndegrade chip performance and even threaten reliability. Conventional\ncircuit-level IR-drop mitigation methods, such as back-end optimizations, are\nresource-intensive and often compromise power, performance, and area (PPA). To\naddress these challenges, we propose AIM, comprehensive software and hardware\nco-design for architecture-level IR-drop mitigation in high-performance PIM.\nInitially, leveraging the bit-serial and in-situ dataflow processing properties\nof PIM, we introduce Rtog and HR, which establish a direct correlation between\nPIM workloads and IR-drop. Building on this foundation, we propose LHR and WDS,\nenabling extensive exploration of architecture-level IR-drop mitigation while\nmaintaining computational accuracy through software optimization. Subsequently,\nwe develop IR-Booster, a dynamic adjustment mechanism that integrates\nsoftware-level HR information with hardware-based IR-drop monitoring to adapt\nthe V-f pairs of the PIM macro, achieving enhanced energy efficiency and\nperformance. Finally, we propose the HR-aware task mapping method, bridging\nsoftware and hardware designs to achieve optimal improvement. Post-layout\nsimulation results on a 7nm 256-TOPS PIM chip demonstrate that AIM achieves up\nto 69.2% IR-drop mitigation, resulting in 2.29x energy efficiency improvement\nand 1.152x speedup.",

      "authors": "Zhengru Fang, Yu Guo, Jingjing Wang, Yuang Zhang, Haonan An, Yinhai Wang, Yuguang Fang",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical\nchallenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited\nbandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a\nmulti-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the\nminimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information\nbottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to\ncommunicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a\ngrid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,\nemerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon\nthis internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient\ncommunication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode\npartners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells\n(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical\nreinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint\nuncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional\nresilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to\n64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast\nbaseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically\nprincipled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social\nrepresentations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social\ncollective intelligence.",

      "snippet": "We study a model of subscription-based platforms where users pay a fixed fee\nfor unlimited access to content, and creators receive a share of the revenue.\nExisting approaches to detecting fraud predominantly rely on machine learning\nmethods, engaging in an ongoing arms race with bad actors. We explore revenue\ndivision mechanisms that inherently disincentivize manipulation. We formalize\nthree types of manipulation-resistance axioms and examine which existing rules\nsatisfy these. We show that a mechanism widely used by streaming platforms, not\nonly fails to prevent fraud, but also makes detecting manipulation\ncomputationally intractable. We also introduce a novel rule, ScaledUserProp,\nthat satisfies all three manipulation-resistance axioms. Finally, experiments\nwith both real-world and synthetic streaming data support ScaledUserProp as a\nfairer alternative compared to existing rules.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but\nthey cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct\nanswers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in\nhigh-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a\nneuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from\nCoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order\nlogic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,\ncommonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation\nenables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises\nallow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.\nExperiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT\neffectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of\nfinal answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for\n(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on\nVeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct\npreference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,\nfurther improving reasoning validity and accuracy.",

      "authors": "Saúl Alonso-Monsalve, Leigh H. Whitehead, Adam Aurisano, Lorena Escudero Sanchez",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "The accurate delineation of tumours in radiological images like Computed\nTomography is a very specialised and time-consuming task, and currently a\nbottleneck preventing quantitative analyses to be performed routinely in the\nclinical setting. For this reason, developing methods for the automated\nsegmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has\ndriven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the\nimpracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed,\nusually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when\napplying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem,\nin this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages,\nvoxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks. This method\nallows segmentations to be performed with high-resolution inputs and a native\n3D model architecture, obtaining state-of-the-art accuracies while\nsignificantly reducing the computational resources needed in terms of GPU\nmemory and time. We studied the deployment of this methodology in the context\nof Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients from the KiTS23\nchallenge, and our method achieved results competitive with the challenge\nwinners, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7%\nfor tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone. Crucially, our method also\noffers significant computational improvements, achieving up to a 60% reduction\nin inference time and up to a 75\\% reduction in VRAM usage compared to an\nequivalent dense architecture, across both CPU and various GPU cards tested.",
