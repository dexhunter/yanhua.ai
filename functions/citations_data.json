      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is\na critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised\nreinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often\npropagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While\nprocess-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they\nlack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific\nsegmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the\nDimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges\nthe gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning\nprocess along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions:\nConfidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and\nCoherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects\nbeyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without\nrequiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides\neffective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances\ntheir reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves\nconsistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain\ntasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles.\nOur findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning\nprocess can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the\ntraining distribution.",

      "authors": "Nianyi Lin, Jiajie Zhang, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large\nlanguage models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood\nfunctions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating\ncorresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods\napproximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via\ncustomized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all\nMC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms\nin the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint\nrestricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations\nand ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose \\emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient\nRL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the\nELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key\nproperties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term\ndepends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation\nacross samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the\nvalue and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based\nobjective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for\nthe original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC\nsample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved\nRL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.\nExperiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for\ndLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.",

      "snippet": "Although large language models excel across many tasks, they can memorise\ntraining data and thereby expose private or copyrighted text. Most defences\ntarget the pre-training stage, leaving memorisation during fine-tuning,\nespecially for domain adaptation and instruction tuning, poorly understood. We\nfine-tune Pythia, Llama3, and Mistral models spanning 1.4B-70B parameters on\ncommon evaluation datasets and track verbatim memorisation throughout training.\nWe find that memorisation increases dramatically in the first few epochs, often\nsignificantly before either validation perplexity or evaluation performance is\noptimised. We use a simple but effective n-gram memorisation score which\nreliably precedes verbatim memorisation; using it as an early-stopping\ncriterion mitigates memorisation with minimal performance loss. Further, we\nintroduce an n-gram-aware loss regulariser and show that it reduces\nmemorisation across all model families tested by up to 40% while minimising\nevaluation performance trade-offs when compared to an existing memorisation\nmitigation strategy. These results yield practical, scalable insights into\nmemorisation dynamics during language model fine-tuning.",

      "authors": "Edward Stevinson, Lucas Prieto, Melih Barsbey, Tolga Birdal",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in\nneural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts\nof the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity\nto non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial\nvulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.\nSpecifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more\nfeatures than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent\nrepresentations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial\nperturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack\npatterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a\nmechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack\ntransferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific\nvulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled\nsuperposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial\nvulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained\non CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct\nof networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning\nprocess or non-robust inputs.",

      "snippet": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models\n(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they\nstill face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,\nsuch as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.\nMost LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while\nmultimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack\nthe necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we\npropose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for \"thinking\nwith images\" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text\nreasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into\nimages as \"visual thought\", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we\nfirst construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark\nfor Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.\nSecond, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art\nimage-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures\ninto codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model\nfor solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model\nachieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully\nvalidating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by\nincorporating external knowledge. While traditional retrieval focuses on\nrelevance, RAG's effectiveness depends on the utility of retrieved passages,\ni.e., the usefulness in facilitating the generation of an accurate and\ncomprehensive answer. Existing studies often treat utility as a generic\nattribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from\nthe same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension\nability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion\nof LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple\ndatasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal\nfor LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across\ndifferent LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the\nLLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some\nhuman-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific\nLLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for\nLLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings,\nwe propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We\nevaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while\nverbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to\nassess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and\nto select truly useful ones for unknown queries.",

      "snippet": "Autonomous vehicles have shown promising potential to be a groundbreaking\ntechnology for improving the safety of road users. For these vehicles, as well\nas many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in\nreal-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to\nunseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL)\nhave demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a\ndiverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown\nsusceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics.\n  In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of\nMBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated\nautonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the\nhead-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision\nprocesses and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the\ncontext of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward\ndynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and\npropose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We\ndemonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to\nout-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We\nalso demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as\nwell as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL\napproaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.",

      "snippet": "Games have long been a microcosm for studying planning and reasoning in both\nnatural and artificial intelligence, especially with a focus on expert-level or\neven super-human play. But real life also pushes human intelligence along a\ndifferent frontier, requiring people to flexibly navigate decision-making\nproblems that they have never thought about before. Here, we use novice\ngameplay to study how people make decisions and form judgments in new problem\nsettings. We show that people are systematic and adaptively rational in how\nthey play a game for the first time, or evaluate a game (e.g., how fair or how\nfun it is likely to be) before they have played it even once. We explain these\ncapacities via a computational cognitive model that we call the \"Intuitive\nGamer\". The model is based on mechanisms of fast and flat (depth-limited)\ngoal-directed probabilistic simulation--analogous to those used in Monte Carlo\ntree-search models of expert game-play, but scaled down to use very few\nstochastic samples, simple goal heuristics for evaluating actions, and no deep\nsearch. In a series of large-scale behavioral studies with over 1000\nparticipants and 121 two-player strategic board games (almost all novel to our\nparticipants), our model quantitatively captures human judgments and decisions\nvarying the amount and kind of experience people have with a game--from no\nexperience at all (\"just thinking\"), to a single round of play, to indirect\nexperience watching another person and predicting how they should play--and\ndoes so significantly better than much more compute-intensive expert-level\nmodels. More broadly, our work offers new insights into how people rapidly\nevaluate, act, and make suggestions when encountering novel problems, and could\ninform the design of more flexible and human-like AI systems that can determine\nnot just how to solve new tasks, but whether a task is worth thinking about at\nall.",

      "snippet": "Learning robotic manipulation policies directly in the real world can be\nexpensive and time-consuming. While reinforcement learning (RL) policies\ntrained in simulation present a scalable alternative, effective sim-to-real\ntransfer remains challenging, particularly for tasks that require precise\ndynamics. To address this, we propose Phys2Real, a real-to-sim-to-real RL\npipeline that combines vision-language model (VLM)-inferred physical parameter\nestimates with interactive adaptation through uncertainty-aware fusion. Our\napproach consists of three core components: (1) high-fidelity geometric\nreconstruction with 3D Gaussian splatting, (2) VLM-inferred prior distributions\nover physical parameters, and (3) online physical parameter estimation from\ninteraction data. Phys2Real conditions policies on interpretable physical\nparameters, refining VLM predictions with online estimates via ensemble-based\nuncertainty quantification. On planar pushing tasks of a T-block with varying\ncenter of mass (CoM) and a hammer with an off-center mass distribution,\nPhys2Real achieves substantial improvements over a domain randomization\nbaseline: 100% vs 79% success rate for the bottom-weighted T-block, 57% vs 23%\nin the challenging top-weighted T-block, and 15% faster average task completion\nfor hammer pushing.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of\nhigh-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have\nallowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can\naugment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like\nsemantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is\nlimited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.\n  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train\nControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control\nmechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the\ntraining distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types\nof control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an\nunlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The\nresulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty\nfrom the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution\nwith labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically\nhigh-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth\nsegmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent\ndevelopment in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower\nquality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation\nnetworks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images\nfrom the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads\nto significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further\nsupervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when\ncompared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any\nstrict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene\nexperiment.",
