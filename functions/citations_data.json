      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) significantly enhances the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this success heavily relies on expensive external verifiers or human rules. Such dependency not only leads to significant computational costs and training latency, but also yields sparse rewards that hinder optimization efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Latent-GRPO, a framework that derives intrinsic rewards directly from latent space geometry. Crucially, our empirical analysis reveals a compelling geometric property: terminal token representations of correct reasoning trajectories form dense clusters with high intra-class similarity, whereas incorrect trajectories remain scattered as outliers. In light of this discovery, we introduce the Iterative Robust Centroid Estimation (IRCE) algorithm, which generates dense, continuous rewards by mitigating magnitude fluctuations via spherical projection and estimating a robust ``truth centroid'' through iterative aggregation. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that our method maintains model performance while achieving a training speedup of over 2x compared to baselines. Furthermore, extensive results demonstrate strong generalization ability and robustness. The code will be released soon.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Automating Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is challenging, and large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect configurations from natural language (NL). We present TerraFormer, a neuro-symbolic framework for IaC generation and mutation that combines supervised fine-tuning with verifier-guided reinforcement learning, using formal verification tools to provide feedback on syntax, deployability, and policy compliance. We curate two large, high-quality NL-to-IaC datasets, TF-Gen (152k instances) and TF-Mutn (52k instances), via multi-stage verification and iterative LLM self-correction. Evaluations against 17 state-of-the-art LLMs, including ~50x larger models like Sonnet 3.7, DeepSeek-R1, and GPT-4.1, show that TerraFormer improves correctness over its base LLM by 15.94% on IaC-Eval, 11.65% on TF-Gen (Test), and 19.60% on TF-Mutn (Test). It outperforms larger models on both TF-Gen (Test) and TF-Mutn (Test), ranks third on IaC-Eval, and achieves top best-practices and security compliance.",

      "authors": "Chenchen Yuan, Bolei Ma, Zheyu Zhang, Bardh Prenkaj, Frauke Kreuter, Gjergji Kasneci",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "While recent research has systematically documented political orientation in large language models (LLMs), existing evaluations rely primarily on direct probing or demographic persona engineering to surface ideological biases. In social psychology, however, political ideology is also understood as a downstream consequence of fundamental moral intuitions. In this work, we investigate the causal relationship between moral values and political positioning by treating moral orientation as a controllable condition. Rather than simply assigning a demographic persona, we condition models to endorse or reject specific moral values and evaluate the resulting shifts on their political orientations, using the Political Compass Test. By treating moral values as lenses, we observe how moral conditioning actively steers model trajectories across economic and social dimensions. Our findings show that such conditioning induces pronounced, value-specific shifts in models' political coordinates. We further notice that these effects are systematically modulated by role framing and model scale, and are robust across alternative assessment instruments instantiating the same moral value. This highlights that effective alignment requires anchoring political assessments within the context of broader social values including morality, paving the way for more socially grounded alignment techniques.",

      "authors": "Wenwen Liao, Hang Ruan",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large models such as Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable superiority over smaller architectures like ResNet in few-shot classification, owing to their powerful representational capacity. However, fine-tuning such large models demands extensive GPU memory and prolonged training time, making them impractical for many real-world low-resource scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose EfficientFSL, a query-only fine-tuning framework tailored specifically for few-shot classification with ViT, which achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. EfficientFSL fully leverages the knowledge embedded in the pre-trained model and its strong comprehension ability, achieving high classification accuracy with an extremely small number of tunable parameters. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight trainable Forward Block to synthesize task-specific queries that extract informative features from the intermediate representations of the pre-trained model in a query-only manner. We further propose a Combine Block to fuse multi-layer outputs, enhancing the depth and robustness of feature representations. Finally, a Support-Query Attention Block mitigates distribution shift by adjusting prototypes to align with the query set distribution. With minimal trainable parameters, EfficientFSL achieves state-of-the-art performance on four in-domain few-shot datasets and six cross-domain datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "With the development of large language models (LLMs) in the field of programming, intelligent programming coaching systems have gained widespread attention. However, most research focuses on repairing the buggy code of programming learners without providing the underlying causes of the bugs. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task, namely \\textbf{LPR} (\\textbf{L}earner-Tailored \\textbf{P}rogram \\textbf{R}epair). We then propose a novel and effective framework, \\textbf{\\textsc{\\MethodName{}}} (\\textbf{L}earner-Tailored \\textbf{S}olution \\textbf{G}enerator), to enhance program repair while offering the bug descriptions for the buggy code. In the first stage, we utilize a repair solution retrieval framework to construct a solution retrieval database and then employ an edit-driven code retrieval approach to retrieve valuable solutions, guiding LLMs in identifying and fixing the bugs in buggy code. In the second stage, we propose a solution-guided program repair method, which fixes the code and provides explanations under the guidance of retrieval solutions. Moreover, we propose an Iterative Retrieval Enhancement method that utilizes evaluation results of the generated code to iteratively optimize the retrieval direction and explore more suitable repair strategies, improving performance in practical programming coaching scenarios. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms a set of baselines by a large margin, validating the effectiveness of our framework for the newly proposed LPR task.",

      "authors": "Zishan Shu, Juntong Wu, Wei Yan, Xudong Liu, Hongyu Zhang, Chang Liu, Youdong Mao, Jie Chen",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Vision modeling has advanced rapidly with Transformers, whose attention mechanisms capture visual dependencies but lack a principled account of how semantic information propagates spatially. We revisit this problem from a wave-based perspective: feature maps are treated as spatial signals whose evolution over an internal propagation time (aligned with network depth) is governed by an underdamped wave equation. In this formulation, spatial frequency-from low-frequency global layout to high-frequency edges and textures-is modeled explicitly, and its interaction with propagation time is controlled rather than implicitly fixed. We derive a closed-form, frequency-time decoupled solution and implement it as the Wave Propagation Operator (WPO), a lightweight module that models global interactions in O(N log N) time-far lower than attention. Building on WPO, we propose a family of WaveFormer models as drop-in replacements for standard ViTs and CNNs, achieving competitive accuracy across image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, while delivering up to 1.6x higher throughput and 30% fewer FLOPs than attention-based alternatives. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that wave propagation introduces a complementary modeling bias to heat-based methods, effectively capturing both global coherence and high-frequency details essential for rich visual semantics.

      "title": "On the use of graph models to achieve individual and group fairness",
      "authors": "Arturo Pérez-Peralta, Sandra Benítez-Peña, Rosa E. Lillo",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Machine Learning algorithms are ubiquitous in key decision-making contexts such as justice, healthcare and finance, which has spawned a great demand for fairness in these procedures. However, the theoretical properties of such models in relation with fairness are still poorly understood, and the intuition behind the relationship between group and individual fairness is still lacking. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework based on Sheaf Diffusion to leverage tools based on dynamical systems and homology to model fairness. Concretely, the proposed method projects input data into a bias-free space that encodes fairness constrains, resulting in fair solutions. Furthermore, we present a collection of network topologies handling different fairness metrics, leading to a unified method capable of dealing with both individual and group bias. The resulting models have a layer of interpretability in the form of closed-form expressions for their SHAP values, consolidating their place in the responsible Artificial Intelligence landscape. Finally, these intuitions are tested on a simulation study and standard fairness benchmarks, where the proposed methods achieve satisfactory results. More concretely, the paper showcases the performance of the proposed models in terms of accuracy and fairness, studying available trade-offs on the Pareto frontier, checking the effects of changing the different hyper-parameters, and delving into the interpretation of its outputs.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "The conceptual design phase in architecture and urban planning, particularly building massing, is complex and heavily reliant on designer intuition and manual effort. To address this, we propose an automated framework for generating building massing based on functional requirements and site context. A primary obstacle to such data-driven methods has been the lack of suitable datasets. Consequently, we introduce the CoMa-20K dataset, a comprehensive collection that includes detailed massing geometries, associated economical and programmatic data, and visual representations of the development site within its existing urban context. We benchmark this dataset by formulating massing generation as a conditional task for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), evaluating both fine-tuned and large zero-shot models. Our experiments reveal the inherent complexity of the task while demonstrating the potential of VLMs to produce context-sensitive massing options. The dataset and analysis establish a foundational benchmark and highlight significant opportunities for future research in data-driven architectural design.",
