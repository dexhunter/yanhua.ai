      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "In this work, we propose a novel method for calibrating Windkessel (WK)\nparameters in a dimensionally reduced 1D-0D coupled blood flow model. To this\nend, we design a data-driven neural network (NN)trained on simulated blood\npressures in the left brachial artery. Once trained, the NN emulates the\npressure pulse waves across the entire simulated domain, i.e., over time, space\nand varying WK parameters, with negligible error and computational effort. To\ncalibrate the WK parameters on a measured pulse wave, the NN is extended by\ndummy neurons and retrained only on these. The main objective of this work is\nto assess the effectiveness of the method in various scenarios -- particularly,\nwhen the exact measurement location is unknown or the data are affected by\nnoise.",

      "snippet": "The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between\nsynthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and\ndiscriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which\ndiscriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key\nfactors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased\ndimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle\ninconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov\ncomplexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very\nsimple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic\nimages; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme\ndiversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets\ncreate the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully\ncapture the distribution and their errors remain visible.",

      "snippet": "Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial\nprototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by\nconstruction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential\nstructure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent\nediting. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and\nCAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline.\nHowever, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard\nlarge language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into\nnatural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics\nand hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We\nconjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's\nprimitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To\nthis end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with\nmodality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level\npooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware\nrepresentations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified\ntext-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction\nfollowing and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative\nperformance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.",

However, real-world PHM presents persistent\nchallenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are\nlimited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly\ncomplex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a\npromising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge\ninto data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and\nobservational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can\nguide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning\nbiases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed\nloss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like\nmonotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to\nensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for\nestimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation,\nand multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these\napproaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active\ndecision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn\nmaintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing\noperational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions,\nsimulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making.\nFinally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions\nfrom individual assets to fleet-wide deployment.

      "authors": "Hao Wu, Yuan Gao, Fan Xu, Fan Zhang, Qingsong Wen, Kun Wang, Xiaomeng Huang, Xian Wu",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a\ngrand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging\nfrom climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,\nparticularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive\npredictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of\nphysical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously\ncapture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:\nlocal, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,\nwe propose the\n{\\textbf{\\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\\textbf{\\underline{I}}}ntegral\n{\\textbf{\\underline{N}}}eural {\\textbf{\\underline{O}}}perator (\\method{}), a\nnovel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator\ndecomposition. \\method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through\nparallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential\noperator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably\nconverges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a\nTransformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This\nphysics-based decomposition endows \\method{} with exceptional stability and\nrobustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow\nbenchmark, we demonstrate that \\method{} significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses\nerror accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both\nthe vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for\nphysically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Real-time urban traffic surveillance is vital for Intelligent Transportation\nSystems (ITS) to ensure road safety, optimize traffic flow, track vehicle\ntrajectories, and prevent collisions in smart cities. Deploying edge cameras\nacross urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road\nconditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a\nrobust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface\nfor user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can\ninterpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment\non edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM\ninference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from\nedge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential\ndelays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we\npropose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces\ntransmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs)\nusing YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into\ncompact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings\nare then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the\ncropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to\ngenerate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9%\nreduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy\nof 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original\ncropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT\nand LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic\nsurveillance.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning\n(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on\nreasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these\nmethods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an\naccuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning\nprocess, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies\nreasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training\nprocess (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).\nSpecifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of\ngranularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,\nand the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to\nindividual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning\ntrajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,\nwhereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens\n(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay\nrates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality\ndistributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates\nreasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it\nacross many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies\nfrom multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct\ncharacteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path\nperspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,\nwith SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for\ndata construction and more efficient learning approaches.",

      "snippet": "The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in\nnext-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled\nheterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,\nwhich offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant\nresearch investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In\nthis work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on\noffloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips\nand traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate\nrevisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present\nSuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses\nHopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.\nSuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as\nadaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware\ncasting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace\nCPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x\nthroughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,\nenabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high\ntraining throughput.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical\nreasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long\nchain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to\nsubstantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often\nutilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which\ndata types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this\npaper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time\nas the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly\nanswer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model\nperformance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value\nreasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract\natomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and\ninductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched\nwith valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity\nalgorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently\nselecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the\ncore set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only\n10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve\nby 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of\ndownstream RL performance by 7.81%.",
