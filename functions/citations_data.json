      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Finite State Machines (FSMs) play a critical role in implementing control\nlogic for Systems-on-Chip (SoC). Traditionally, FSMs are implemented by\nhardware engineers through Verilog coding, which is often tedious and\ntime-consuming. Recently, with the remarkable progress of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) in code generation, LLMs have been increasingly explored for automating\nVerilog code generation. However, LLM-generated Verilog code often suffers from\nsecurity vulnerabilities, which is particularly concerning for\nsecurity-sensitive FSM implementations. To address this issue, we propose\nSecFSM, a novel method that leverages a security-oriented knowledge graph to\nguide LLMs in generating more secure Verilog code. Specifically, we first\nconstruct a FSM Security Knowledge Graph (FSKG) as an external aid to LLMs.\nSubsequently, we analyze users' requirements to identify vulnerabilities and\nget a list of vulnerabilities in the requirements. Then, we retrieve knowledge\nfrom FSKG based on the vulnerabilities list. Finally, we construct security\nprompts based on the security knowledge for Verilog code generation. To\nevaluate SecFSM, we build a dedicated dataset collected from academic datasets,\nartificial datasets, papers, and industrial cases. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that SecFSM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In particular,\non a benchmark of 25 security test cases evaluated by DeepSeek-R1, SecFSM\nachieves an outstanding pass rate of 21/25.",

      "snippet": "Thinking LLMs solve complex tasks at the expense of increased compute and\noverthinking on simpler problems, while non-thinking LLMs are faster and\ncheaper but underthink on harder reasoning problems. This has led to the\ndevelopment of separate thinking and non-thinking LLM variants, leaving the\nonus of selecting the optimal model for each query on the end user. In this\nwork, we introduce OptimalThinkingBench, a unified benchmark that jointly\nevaluates overthinking and underthinking in LLMs and also encourages the\ndevelopment of optimally-thinking models that balance performance and\nefficiency. Our benchmark comprises two sub-benchmarks: OverthinkingBench,\nfeaturing simple queries in 72 domains, and UnderthinkingBench, containing 11\nchallenging reasoning tasks. Using novel thinking-adjusted accuracy metrics, we\nperform extensive evaluation of 33 different thinking and non-thinking models\nand show that no model is able to optimally think on our benchmark. Thinking\nmodels often overthink for hundreds of tokens on the simplest user queries\nwithout improving performance. In contrast, large non-thinking models\nunderthink, often falling short of much smaller thinking models. We further\nexplore several methods to encourage optimal thinking, but find that these\napproaches often improve on one sub-benchmark at the expense of the other,\nhighlighting the need for better unified and optimal models in the future.",

In this paper, we explore the\nreasons behind the vulnerability of LRMs. Based on this, we propose a novel\nmethod to improve the safety of LLMs without sacrificing their reasoning\ncapability. Specifically, we exploit the competition between LRM's reasoning\nability and safety ability, and achieve jailbreak by improving LRM's reasoning\nperformance to reduce its safety performance. We then introduce an alignment\nstrategy based on Fuzzification to balance Safety-Reasoning (FuSaR), by\ndetoxifying the harmful reasoning process, where both the dangerous entities\nand the dangerous procedures in the reasoning steps are hidden. FuSaR\nsuccessfully mitigates safety risks while preserving core reasoning\ninformation. We validate this strategy through alignment experiments on several\nopen-source LRMs using detoxified reasoning data. The results compared with\nexisting baselines conclusively show that FuSaR is an efficient alignment\nstrategy to simultaneously enhance both the reasoning capability and safety of\nLRMs.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Timely detection of hardware vulnerabilities during the early design stage is\ncritical for reducing remediation costs. Existing early detection techniques\noften require specialized security expertise, limiting their usability. Recent\nefforts have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for Verilog\nvulnerability detection. However, LLMs struggle to capture the structure in\nVerilog code, resulting in inconsistent detection results. To this end, we\npropose VerilogLAVD, the first LLM-aided graph traversal rule generation\napproach for Verilog vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces the\nVerilog Property Graph (VeriPG), a unified representation of Verilog code. It\ncombines syntactic features extracted from the abstract syntax tree (AST) with\nsemantic information derived from control flow and data dependency graphs. We\nleverage LLMs to generate VeriPG-based detection rules from Common Weakness\nEnumeration (CWE) descriptions. These rules guide the rule executor that\ntraversal VeriPG for potential vulnerabilities. To evaluate VerilogLAVD, we\nbuild a dataset collected from open-source repositories and synthesized data.\nIn our empirical evaluation on 77 Verilog designs encompassing 12 CWE types,\nVerilogLAVD achieves an F1-score of 0.54.

      "snippet": "E-graphs have attracted growing interest in many fields, particularly in\nlogic synthesis and formal verification. E-graph extraction is a challenging\nNP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. It requires identifying optimal\nterms from exponentially many equivalent expressions, serving as the primary\nperformance bottleneck in e-graph based optimization tasks. However,\ntraditional extraction methods face a critical trade-off: heuristic approaches\noffer speed but sacrifice optimality, while exact methods provide optimal\nsolutions but face prohibitive computational costs on practical problems. We\npresent e-boost, a novel framework that bridges this gap through three key\ninnovations: (1) parallelized heuristic extraction that leverages weak data\ndependence to compute DAG costs concurrently, enabling efficient multi-threaded\nperformance without sacrificing extraction quality; (2) adaptive search space\npruning that employs a parameterized threshold mechanism to retain only\npromising candidates, dramatically reducing the solution space while preserving\nnear-optimal solutions; and (3) initialized exact solving that formulates the\nreduced problem as an Integer Linear Program with warm-start capabilities,\nguiding solvers toward high-quality solutions faster.\n  Across the diverse benchmarks in formal verification and logic synthesis\nfields, e-boost demonstrates 558x runtime speedup over traditional exact\napproaches (ILP) and 19.04% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art\nextraction framework (SmoothE).

Inflatable structures are a\nprominent example, using internal pressurization to realize large, nonlinear\ndeformations in applications ranging from soft robotics and deployable\naerospace systems to biomedical devices and adaptive architecture. We present a\ngenerative design framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models\n(DDPMs) for the inverse design of elastic structures undergoing large,\nnonlinear deformations under pressure-driven actuation. The method formulates\nthe inverse design as a conditional generation task, using geometric\ndescriptors of target deformed states as inputs and outputting image-based\nrepresentations of the undeformed configuration. Representing these\nconfigurations as simple images is achieved by establishing a pre- and\npostprocessing pipeline that involves a fixed image processing, simulation\nsetup, and descriptor extraction methods.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "The growing demand for sparse tensor algebra (SpTA) in machine learning and\nbig data has driven the development of various sparse tensor accelerators.\nHowever, most existing manually designed accelerators are limited to specific\nscenarios, and it's time-consuming and challenging to adjust a large number of\ndesign factors when scenarios change. Therefore, automating the design of SpTA\naccelerators is crucial. Nevertheless, previous works focus solely on either\nmapping (i.e., tiling communication and computation in space and time) or\nsparse strategy (i.e., bypassing zero elements for efficiency), leading to\nsuboptimal designs due to the lack of comprehensive consideration of both. A\nunified framework that jointly optimizes both is urgently needed. However,\nintegrating mapping and sparse strategies leads to a combinatorial explosion in\nthe design space(e.g., as large as $O(10^{41})$ for the workload $P_{32 \\times\n64} \\times Q_{64 \\times 48} = Z_{32 \\times 48}$). This vast search space\nrenders most conventional optimization methods (e.g., particle swarm\noptimization, reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search) inefficient.\nTo address this challenge, we propose an evolution strategy-based sparse tensor\naccelerator optimization framework, called SparseMap. SparseMap constructing a\nmore comprehensive design space with the consideration of both mapping and\nsparse strategy. We introduce a series of enhancements to genetic encoding and\nevolutionary operators, enabling SparseMap to efficiently explore the vast and\ndiverse design space. We quantitatively compare SparseMap with prior works and\nclassical optimization methods, demonstrating that SparseMap consistently finds\nsuperior solutions.",
