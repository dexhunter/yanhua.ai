      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in\npreserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme\nillumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV\n(Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global\nEdge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and\nedge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV\nAttention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity\nand models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the\nBilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align\nluminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating\nartifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV\nachieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low\ncomputational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in\nlow-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization\ncapabilities.",

It is developed by our\nproposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,\nsafety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of\nmulti-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that\nsimply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop\nintrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety\n`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of\n$46.54\\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks\nwithout compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety\nperformance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude\nOpus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct\ninference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,\nenforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop\nSafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and\nSafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and\ncapability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of\nour framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general\ndomains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches\ntypically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using\nunlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods\neither incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,\nwhile also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To\naddress these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing\ninstruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding\nunlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,\nand Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning\nprocesses and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,\ncustomizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any\ntask. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful\ndata synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3\nwhile utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates\nthat our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source\ncode, models, and scripts are available at https://github.com/Krueske/AQuilt.",

      "snippet": "Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models\n(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following\nheuristic-based \"Think step by step\" approaches, the field has evolved in two\nmain directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit\nimproved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent\nline of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,\ntailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we\nintroduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these\napproaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the\nprompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is\nbeing iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When\ncoupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a \"good\"\nprompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us\nto train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for\nthe problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.",

      "snippet": "A fundamental requirement for full autonomy in mobile robots is accurate\nnavigation even in situations where satellite navigation or cameras are\nunavailable. In such practical situations, relying only on inertial sensors\nwill result in navigation solution drift due to the sensors' inherent noise and\nerror terms. One of the emerging solutions to mitigate drift is to maneuver the\nrobot in a snake-like slithering motion to increase the inertial\nsignal-to-noise ratio, allowing the regression of the mobile robot position. In\nthis work, we propose MoRPI-PINN as a physics-informed neural network framework\nfor accurate inertial-based mobile robot navigation. By embedding physical laws\nand constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing\nan accurate and robust navigation solution. Using real-world experiments, we\nshow accuracy improvements of over 85% compared to other approaches. MoRPI-PINN\nis a lightweight approach that can be implemented even on edge devices and used\nin any typical mobile robot application.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress\nin reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable\nrewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively\nincentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\ntrajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,\nexisting approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the\ndevelopment of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a\ntheoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information\nbottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),\na framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about\nthe final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a\npractical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient\napproximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This\ntechnique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks\nwithout additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code\nmodification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent\nimprovements in LLM reasoning performance.",

A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove\nerrors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.\nOnce formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying\nautomated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We\nconsider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving\nand term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving\ntrigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and\nestablishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we\ndescribe it in some detail in the paper.

We introduce PosterMate, a poster\ndesign assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven\npersona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers\nfeedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates\ndiscussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These\nagreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design.\nThrough our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to\ncapture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool.\nAdditionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the\nfeedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona\nidentity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona\nagents' perspectives.",
