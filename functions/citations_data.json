      "snippet": "The creation of human-like humanoid robots is hindered by a fundamental\nfragmentation: data processing and learning algorithms are rarely universal\nacross different robot morphologies. This paper introduces the Generalized\nBehavior Cloning (GBC) framework, a comprehensive and unified solution designed\nto solve this end-to-end challenge. GBC establishes a complete pathway from\nhuman motion to robot action through three synergistic innovations. First, an\nadaptive data pipeline leverages a differentiable IK network to automatically\nretarget any human MoCap data to any humanoid. Building on this foundation, our\nnovel DAgger-MMPPO algorithm with its MMTransformer architecture learns robust,\nhigh-fidelity imitation policies. To complete the ecosystem, the entire\nframework is delivered as an efficient, open-source platform based on Isaac\nLab, empowering the community to deploy the full workflow via simple\nconfiguration scripts. We validate the power and generality of GBC by training\npolicies on multiple heterogeneous humanoids, demonstrating excellent\nperformance and transfer to novel motions. This work establishes the first\npractical and unified pathway for creating truly generalized humanoid\ncontrollers.",

      "snippet": "Edge General Intelligence (EGI) represents a transformative evolution of edge\ncomputing, where distributed agents possess the capability to perceive, reason,\nand act autonomously across diverse, dynamic environments. Central to this\nvision are world models, which act as proactive internal simulators that not\nonly predict but also actively imagine future trajectories, reason under\nuncertainty, and plan multi-step actions with foresight. This proactive nature\nallows agents to anticipate potential outcomes and optimize decisions ahead of\nreal-world interactions. While prior works in robotics and gaming have\nshowcased the potential of world models, their integration into the wireless\nedge for EGI remains underexplored. This survey bridges this gap by offering a\ncomprehensive analysis of how world models can empower agentic artificial\nintelligence (AI) systems at the edge. We first examine the architectural\nfoundations of world models, including latent representation learning, dynamics\nmodeling, and imagination-based planning. Building on these core capabilities,\nwe illustrate their proactive applications across EGI scenarios such as\nvehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, the Internet of\nThings (IoT) systems, and network functions virtualization, thereby\nhighlighting how they can enhance optimization under latency, energy, and\nprivacy constraints. We then explore their synergy with foundation models and\ndigital twins, positioning world models as the cognitive backbone of EGI.\nFinally, we highlight open challenges, such as safety guarantees, efficient\ntraining, and constrained deployment, and outline future research directions.\nThis survey provides both a conceptual foundation and a practical roadmap for\nrealizing the next generation of intelligent, autonomous edge systems.",

      "authors": "Baran Atalar, Eddie Zhang, Carlee Joe-Wong",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) for a variety\nof tasks, there has been a growing interest in strategies that can predict\nwhich out of a set of LLMs will yield a successful answer at low cost. This\nproblem promises to become more and more relevant as providers like Microsoft\nallow users to easily create custom LLM \"assistants\" specialized to particular\ntypes of queries. However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized\nand difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often\nbenefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can\nthen be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask.\nFor example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first\nselect an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary,\nand then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from\nthe summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms,\nthis setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of\neach LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success. Thus,\nunlike single LLM selection, the quality of each subtask's output directly\naffects the inputs, and hence the cost and success rate, of downstream LLMs,\ncreating complex performance dependencies that must be learned and accounted\nfor during selection. We propose a neural contextual bandit-based algorithm\nthat trains neural networks that model LLM success on each subtask in an online\nmanner, thus learning to guide the LLM selections for the different subtasks,\neven in the absence of historical LLM performance data. Experiments on\ntelecommunications question answering and medical diagnosis prediction datasets\nillustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to other LLM\nselection algorithms.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Conventional single-dataset training often fails with new data distributions,\nespecially in ultrasound (US) image analysis due to limited data, acoustic\nshadows, and speckle noise. Therefore, constructing a universal framework for\nmulti-heterogeneous US datasets is imperative. However, a key challenge arises:\nhow to effectively mitigate inter-dataset interference while preserving\ndataset-specific discriminative features for robust downstream task? Previous\napproaches utilize either a single source-specific decoder or a domain\nadaptation strategy, but these methods experienced a decline in performance\nwhen applied to other domains. Considering this, we propose a Universal\nCollaborative Mixture of Heterogeneous Source-Specific Experts (COME).\nSpecifically, COME establishes dual structure-semantic shared experts that\ncreate a universal representation space and then collaborate with\nsource-specific experts to extract discriminative features through providing\ncomplementary features. This design enables robust generalization by leveraging\ncross-datasets experience distributions and providing universal US priors for\nsmall-batch or unseen data scenarios. Extensive experiments under three\nevaluation modes (single-dataset, intra-organ, and inter-organ integration\ndatasets) demonstrate COME's superiority, achieving significant mean AP\nimprovements over state-of-the-art methods.

To address these limitations, we introduce\nPreacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a top-down\napproach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by\nbottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent\nabstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and\nintroduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative\nplanning.

While recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can\nbe effective context-aided forecasters via na\\\"ive direct prompting, their full\npotential remains underexplored. We address this gap with 4 strategies,\nproviding new insights into the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in this setting.\nReDP improves interpretability by eliciting explicit reasoning traces, allowing\nus to assess the model's reasoning over the context independently from its\nforecast accuracy. CorDP leverages LLMs solely to refine existing forecasts\nwith context, enhancing their applicability in real-world forecasting\npipelines. IC-DP proposes embedding historical examples of context-aided\nforecasting tasks in the prompt, substantially improving accuracy even for the\nlargest models. Finally, RouteDP optimizes resource efficiency by using LLMs to\nestimate task difficulty, and routing the most challenging tasks to larger\nmodels. Evaluated on different kinds of context-aided forecasting tasks from\nthe CiK benchmark, our strategies demonstrate distinct benefits over na\\\"ive\nprompting across LLMs of different sizes and families.

      "snippet": "Vision-driven autonomous river following by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is\ncritical for applications such as rescue, surveillance, and environmental\nmonitoring, particularly in dense riverine environments where GPS signals are\nunreliable. We formalize river following as a coverage control problem in which\nthe reward function is submodular, yielding diminishing returns as more unique\nriver segments are visited, thereby framing the task as a Submodular Markov\nDecision Process. First, we introduce Marginal Gain Advantage Estimation, which\nrefines the reward advantage function by using a sliding window baseline\ncomputed from historical episodic returns, thus aligning the advantage\nestimation with the agent's evolving recognition of action value in\nnon-Markovian settings. Second, we develop a Semantic Dynamics Model based on\npatchified water semantic masks that provides more interpretable and\ndata-efficient short-term prediction of future observations compared to latent\nvision dynamics models. Third, we present the Constrained Actor Dynamics\nEstimator architecture, which integrates the actor, the cost estimator, and SDM\nfor cost advantage estimation to form a model-based SafeRL framework capable of\nsolving partially observable Constrained Submodular Markov Decision Processes.\nSimulation results demonstrate that MGAE achieves faster convergence and\nsuperior performance over traditional critic-based methods like Generalized\nAdvantage Estimation. SDM provides more accurate short-term state predictions\nthat enable the cost estimator to better predict potential violations. Overall,\nCADE effectively integrates safety regulation into model-based RL, with the\nLagrangian approach achieving the soft balance of reward and safety during\ntraining, while the safety layer enhances performance during inference by hard\naction overlay.",

      "snippet": "The new paradigm of test-time scaling has yielded remarkable breakthroughs in\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) (e.g. reasoning models) and in generative vision\nmodels, allowing models to allocate additional computation during inference to\neffectively tackle increasingly complex problems. Despite the improvements of\nthis approach, an important limitation emerges: the substantial increase in\ncomputation time makes the process slow and impractical for many applications.\nGiven the success of this paradigm and its growing usage, we seek to preserve\nits benefits while eschewing the inference overhead. In this work we propose\none solution to the critical problem of integrating test-time scaling knowledge\ninto a model during post-training.

The capability of LLMs to generate accurate answers and detailed\nsolutions for math problem-solving tasks is foundational for ensuring reliable\nand precise feedback and assessment in math education practices. Our study\nfocuses on evaluating the accuracy of four LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o and o1,\nDeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1) solving three categories of math tasks, including\narithmetic, algebra, and number theory, and identifies step-level reasoning\nerrors within their solutions. Instead of relying on standard benchmarks, we\nintentionally build math tasks (via item models) that are challenging for LLMs\nand prone to errors. The accuracy of final answers and the presence of errors\nin individual solution steps were systematically analyzed and coded. Both\nsingle-agent and dual-agent configurations were tested. It is observed that the\nreasoning-enhanced OpenAI o1 model consistently achieved higher or nearly\nperfect accuracy across all three math task categories. Analysis of errors\nrevealed that procedural slips were the most frequent and significantly\nimpacted overall performance, while conceptual misunderstandings were less\nfrequent.

Although some\nmethods suggest that small but targeted dataset can incentivize reasoning via\nonly distillation, a reasoning scaling laws is still taking shape, increasing\ncomputational costs. To address this, we propose a data-efficient distillation\nframework (DED) that optimizes the Pareto frontier of reasoning distillation.\nInspired by the on-policy learning and diverse roll-out strategies of\nreinforcement learning, the key idea of our approach is threefold: (1) We\nidentify that benchmark scores alone do not determine an effective teacher\nmodel. Through comprehensive comparisons of leading reasoning LLMs, we develop\na method to select an optimal teacher model. (2) While scaling distillation can\nenhance reasoning, it often degrades out-of-domain performance. A carefully\ncurated, smaller corpus achieves a balanced trade-off between in-domain and\nout-of-domain capabilities. (3) Diverse reasoning trajectories encourage the\nstudent model to develop robust reasoning skills. We validate our method\nthrough evaluations on mathematical reasoning (AIME 2024/2025, MATH-500) and\ncode generation (LiveCodeBench), achieving state-of-the-art results with only\n0.8k carefully curated examples, bypassing the need for extensive scaling.
