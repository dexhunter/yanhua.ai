      "title": "Incentivizing Tool-augmented Thinking with Images for Medical Image Analysis",
      "authors": "Yankai Jiang, Yujie Zhang, Peng Zhang, Yichen Li, Jintai Chen, Xiaoming Shi, Shihui Zhen",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Recent reasoning based medical MLLMs have made progress in generating step by step textual reasoning chains. However, they still struggle with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on fine-grained visual regions to achieve precise grounding and diagnosis. We introduce Ophiuchus, a versatile, tool-augmented framework that equips an MLLM to (i) decide when additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine where to probe and ground within the medical image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved, multimodal chain of thought. In contrast to prior approaches limited by the performance ceiling of specialized tools, Ophiuchus integrates the model's inherent grounding and perception capabilities with external tools, thereby fostering higher-level reasoning. The core of our method is a three-stage training strategy: cold-start training with tool-integrated reasoning data to achieve basic tool selection and adaptation for inspecting key regions; self-reflection fine-tuning to strengthen reflective reasoning and encourage revisiting tool outputs; and Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning to directly optimize task-specific rewards and emulate expert-like diagnostic behavior. Extensive experiments show that Ophiuchus consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods across diverse medical benchmarks, including VQA, detection, and reasoning-based segmentation. Our approach illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely \"think with images\" through tool-integrated reasoning. Datasets, codes, and trained models will be released publicly.",

      "authors": "Fangzhou Lin, Guoshun He, Zhenyu Guo, Zhe Huang, Jinsong Tao",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Electric load is simultaneously affected across multiple time scales by exogenous factors such as weather and calendar rhythms, sudden events, and policies. Therefore, this paper proposes GRAFT (GRid-Aware Forecasting with Text), which modifies and improves STanHOP to better support grid-aware forecasting and multi-source textual interventions. Specifically, GRAFT strictly aligns daily-aggregated news, social media, and policy texts with half-hour load, and realizes text-guided fusion to specific time positions via cross-attention during both training and rolling forecasting. In addition, GRAFT provides a plug-and-play external-memory interface to accommodate different information sources in real-world deployment. We construct and release a unified aligned benchmark covering 2019--2021 for five Australian states (half-hour load, daily-aligned weather/calendar variables, and three categories of external texts), and conduct systematic, reproducible evaluations at three scales -- hourly, daily, and monthly -- under a unified protocol for comparison across regions, external sources, and time scales. Experimental results show that GRAFT significantly outperforms strong baselines and reaches or surpasses the state of the art across multiple regions and forecasting horizons. Moreover, the model is robust in event-driven scenarios and enables temporal localization and source-level interpretation of text-to-load effects through attention read-out. We release the benchmark, preprocessing scripts, and forecasting results to facilitate standardized empirical evaluation and reproducibility in power grid load forecasting.",

      "authors": "Rao Muhammad Umer, Daniel Sens, Jonathan Noll, Christian Matek, Lukas Wolfseher, Rainer Spang, Ralf Huss, Johannes Raffler, Sarah Reinke, Wolfram Klapper, Katja Steiger, Kristina Schwamborn, Carsten Marr",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Timely and accurate lymphoma diagnosis is essential for guiding cancer treatment. Standard diagnostic practice combines hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular genetic tests to determine lymphoma subtypes, a process requiring costly equipment, skilled personnel, and causing treatment delays. Deep learning methods could assist pathologists by extracting diagnostic information from routinely available HE-stained slides, yet comprehensive benchmarks for lymphoma subtyping on multicenter data are lacking. In this work, we present the first multicenter lymphoma benchmarking dataset covering four common lymphoma subtypes and healthy control tissue. We systematically evaluate five publicly available pathology foundation models (H-optimus-1, H0-mini, Virchow2, UNI2, Titan) combined with attention-based (AB-MIL) and transformer-based (TransMIL) multiple instance learning aggregators across three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x). On in-distribution test sets, models achieve multiclass balanced accuracies exceeding 80% across all magnifications, with all foundation models performing similarly and both aggregation methods showing comparable results. The magnification study reveals that 40x resolution is sufficient, with no performance gains from higher resolutions or cross-magnification aggregation. However, on out-of-distribution test sets, performance drops substantially to around 60%, highlighting significant generalization challenges. To advance the field, larger multicenter studies covering additional rare lymphoma subtypes are needed. We provide an automated benchmarking pipeline to facilitate such future research.",

      "authors": "Kelly J. Davis",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Formal, automated theorem proving has long been viewed as a challenge to artificial intelligence. We introduce here a new approach to computer theorem proving, one that employs specialized language models for Lean4 proof generation combined with recursive decomposition of difficult theorems into simpler entailing propositions. These models are coordinated through a multi-agent architecture that orchestrates autoformalization (if required), proof generation, decomposition of difficult theorems into simpler entailing propositions, and recursive proof (and/or decomposition) of these propositions. Without decomposition, we achieve a 90.4% pass rate on miniF2F. With decomposition, this is significantly improved. A key technical contribution lies in our extension of the Kimina Lean Server with abstract syntax tree (AST) parsing capabilities to facilitate automated, recursive proof decomposition. The system is made available on PyPI as goedels-poetry (at https://pypi.org/project/goedels-poetry ), and the open-source implementation KellyJDavis/goedels-poetry (at https://github.com/KellyJDavis/goedels-poetry ) facilitates both adaptation to alternative language models and extension with custom functionality.",
