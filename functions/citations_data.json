      "title": "SEAM: Semantically Equivalent Across Modalities Benchmark for\n  Vision-Language Models",
      "authors": "Zhenwei Tang, Difan Jiao, Blair Yang, Ashton Anderson",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Evaluating whether vision-language models (VLMs) reason consistently across\nrepresentations is challenging because modality comparisons are typically\nconfounded by task differences and asymmetric information. We introduce SEAM, a\nbenchmark that pairs semantically equivalent inputs across four domains that\nhave existing standardized textual and visual notations. By employing distinct\nnotation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text\npairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the\ntextual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21\ncontemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision\nfrequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems\ncontaining semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is\nrelatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception\nfailures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures\nthat induce hallucinations. We also show that our results are largely robust to\nvisual transformations. SEAM establishes a controlled, semantically equivalent\nsetting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning.",

      "authors": "Mohammad J. Abdel-Rahman, Yasmeen Alslman, Dania Refai, Amro Saleh, Malik A. Abu Loha, Mohammad Yahya Hamed",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "This paper investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in\nformulating and solving decision-making problems using mathematical\nprogramming. We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent\nliterature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve\noptimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review\nquestions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics,\nand prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted\nexperiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in\nautomatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks.\nUsing a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies:\nAct-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the\nobtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation\naccuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs' ability to parse natural\nlanguage and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations\nin accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate\nseveral future research directions, including structured datasets,\ndomain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular\nmulti-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs. This paper\ncontributes a structured roadmap for advancing LLM capabilities in mathematical\nprogramming.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "The urgent need for renewable energy expansion, particularly wind power, is\nhindered by conflicts with wildlife conservation. To address this, we developed\nBirdRecorder, an advanced AI-based anti-collision system to protect endangered\nbirds, especially the red kite (Milvus milvus). Integrating robotics,\ntelemetry, and high-performance AI algorithms, BirdRecorder aims to detect,\ntrack, and classify avian species within a range of 800 m to minimize\nbird-turbine collisions.\n  BirdRecorder integrates advanced AI methods with optimized hardware and\nsoftware architectures to enable real-time image processing. Leveraging Single\nShot Detector (SSD) for detection, combined with specialized hardware\nacceleration and tracking algorithms, our system achieves high detection\nprecision while maintaining the speed necessary for real-time decision-making.\nBy combining these components, BirdRecorder outperforms existing approaches in\nboth accuracy and efficiency.\n  In this paper, we summarize results on field tests and performance of the\nBirdRecorder system. By bridging the gap between renewable energy expansion and\nwildlife conservation, BirdRecorder contributes to a more sustainable\ncoexistence of technology and nature.",
