      "authors": "Ganesh Sundaram, Jonas Ulmen, Amjad Haider, Daniel Görges",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "The rapid growth of resource-constrained mobile platforms, including mobile\nrobots, wearable systems, and Internet-of-Things devices, has increased the\ndemand for computationally efficient neural network controllers (NNCs) that can\noperate within strict hardware limitations. While deep neural networks (DNNs)\ndemonstrate superior performance in control applications, their substantial\ncomputational complexity and memory requirements present significant barriers\nto practical deployment on edge devices. This paper introduces a comprehensive\nmodel compression methodology that leverages component-aware structured pruning\nto determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each pruning group, ensuring a\nbalance between compression and stability for NNC deployment. Our approach is\nrigorously evaluated on Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC),\na state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, with a\nsystematic integration of mathematical stability guarantee properties,\nspecifically Lyapunov criteria. The key contribution of this work lies in\nproviding a principled framework for determining the theoretical limits of\nmodel compression while preserving controller stability. Experimental\nvalidation demonstrates that our methodology successfully reduces model\ncomplexity while maintaining requisite control performance and stability\ncharacteristics. Furthermore, our approach establishes a quantitative boundary\nfor safe compression ratios, enabling practitioners to systematically determine\nthe maximum permissible model reduction before violating critical stability\nproperties, thereby facilitating the confident deployment of compressed NNCs in\nresource-limited environments.",

      "authors": "Pedro Orvalho, Marta Kwiatkowska",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Python has become the dominant language for general-purpose programming, yet\nit lacks robust tools for formal verification. In contrast, programmers working\nin languages such as C benefit from mature model checkers, for example CBMC,\nwhich enable exhaustive symbolic reasoning and fault localisation. The inherent\ncomplexity of Python, coupled with the verbosity and low-level nature of\nexisting transpilers (e.g., Cython), have historically limited the\napplicability of formal verification to Python programs.\n  In this paper, we propose PyVeritas, a novel framework that leverages Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) for high-level transpilation from Python to C, followed\nby bounded model checking and MaxSAT-based fault localisation in the generated\nC code. PyVeritas enables verification and bug localisation for Python code\nusing existing model checking tools for C. Our empirical evaluation on two\nPython benchmarks demonstrates that LLM-based transpilation can achieve a high\ndegree of accuracy, up to 80--90% for some LLMs, enabling effective development\nenvironment that supports assertion-based verification and interpretable fault\ndiagnosis for small yet non-trivial Python programs.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most prevalent form of breast cancer,\nand early, accurate diagnosis is critical to improving patient survival rates\nby guiding treatment decisions. Combining medical expertise with artificial\nintelligence (AI) holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and\nefficiency of IDC detection. In this work, we propose a human-in-the-loop\n(HITL) deep learning system designed to detect IDC in histopathology images.\nThe system begins with an initial diagnosis provided by a high-performance\nEfficientNetV2S model, offering feedback from AI to the human expert. Medical\nprofessionals then review the AI-generated results, correct any misclassified\nimages, and integrate the revised labels into the training dataset, forming a\nfeedback loop from the human back to the AI. This iterative process refines the\nmodel's performance over time. The EfficientNetV2S model itself achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods in the literature,\nwith an overall accuracy of 93.65\\%. Incorporating the human-in-the-loop system\nfurther improves the model's accuracy using four experimental groups with\nmisclassified images. These results demonstrate the potential of this\ncollaborative approach to enhance AI performance in diagnostic systems.

      "snippet": "Knowledge Tracing (KT) is committed to capturing students' knowledge mastery\nfrom their historical interactions. Simulating students' memory states is a\npromising approach to enhance both the performance and interpretability of\nknowledge tracing models. Memory consists of three fundamental processes:\nencoding, storage, and retrieval. Although forgetting primarily manifests\nduring the storage stage, most existing studies rely on a single,\nundifferentiated forgetting mechanism, overlooking other memory processes as\nwell as personalized forgetting patterns. To address this, this paper proposes\nmemoryKT, a knowledge tracing model based on a novel temporal variational\nautoencoder. The model simulates memory dynamics through a three-stage process:\n(i) Learning the distribution of students' knowledge memory features, (ii)\nReconstructing their exercise feedback, while (iii) Embedding a personalized\nforgetting module within the temporal workflow to dynamically modulate memory\nstorage strength. This jointly models the complete encoding-storage-retrieval\ncycle, significantly enhancing the model's perception capability for individual\ndifferences. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our\nproposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Effective multi-shot generation demands purposeful, film-like transitions and\nstrict cinematic continuity. Current methods, however, often prioritize basic\nvisual consistency, neglecting crucial editing patterns (e.g., shot/reverse\nshot, cutaways) that drive narrative flow for compelling storytelling. This\nyields outputs that may be visually coherent but lack narrative sophistication\nand true cinematic integrity. To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation\n(NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to\nprofessional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity.\nOur framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It employs\nin-context tuning guided by a novel Hierarchical Multi-Prompting strategy. This\nstrategy uses Relational Prompts to define overall context and inter-shot\nediting styles. Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and\ncinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate\ncinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware\nCondition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further\nintegrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters. We\nconstruct RawCuts (large-scale) and CuratedCuts (refined) datasets, both with\nhierarchical prompts, and introduce CutBench for evaluation. Experiments show\nCut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity. Crucially, user\nstudies reveal a strong preference for Cut2Next, particularly for its adherence\nto intended editing patterns and overall cinematic continuity, validating its\nability to generate high-quality, narratively expressive, and cinematically\ncoherent subsequent shots.",

      "snippet": "We present LL3M, a multi-agent system that leverages pretrained large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to generate 3D assets by writing interpretable Python\ncode in Blender. We break away from the typical generative approach that learns\nfrom a collection of 3D data. Instead, we reformulate shape generation as a\ncode-writing task, enabling greater modularity, editability, and integration\nwith artist workflows. Given a text prompt, LL3M coordinates a team of\nspecialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender\nscripts that generate and edit geometry and appearance. The generated code\nworks as a high-level, interpretable, human-readable, well-documented\nrepresentation of scenes and objects, making full use of sophisticated Blender\nconstructs (e.g. B-meshes, geometry modifiers, shader nodes) for diverse,\nunconstrained shapes, materials, and scenes. This code presents many avenues\nfor further agent and human editing and experimentation via code tweaks or\nprocedural parameters. This medium naturally enables a co-creative loop in our\nsystem: agents can automatically self-critique using code and visuals, while\niterative user instructions provide an intuitive way to refine assets. A shared\ncode context across agents enables awareness of previous attempts, and a\nretrieval-augmented generation knowledge base built from Blender API\ndocumentation, BlenderRAG, equips agents with examples, types, and functions\nempowering advanced modeling operations and code correctness. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of LL3M across diverse shape categories, style and material\nedits, and user-driven refinements.

      "snippet": "Recent AI code assistants have significantly improved their ability to\nprocess more complex contexts and generate entire codebases based on a textual\ndescription, compared to the popular snippet-level generation. These codebase\nAI assistants (CBAs) can also extend or adapt codebases, allowing users to\nfocus on higher-level design and deployment decisions. While prior work has\nextensively studied the impact of snippet-level code generation, this new class\nof codebase generation models is relatively unexplored. Despite initial\nanecdotal reports of excitement about these agents, they remain less frequently\nadopted compared to snippet-level code assistants. To utilize CBAs better, we\nneed to understand how developers interact with CBAs, and how and why CBAs fall\nshort of developers' needs. In this paper, we explored these gaps through a\ncounterbalanced user study and interview with (n = 16) students and developers\nworking on coding tasks with CBAs. We found that participants varied the\ninformation in their prompts, like problem description (48% of prompts),\nrequired functionality (98% of prompts), code structure (48% of prompts), and\ntheir prompt writing process. Despite various strategies, the overall\nsatisfaction score with generated codebases remained low (mean = 2.8, median =\n3, on a scale of one to five). Participants mentioned functionality as the most\ncommon factor for dissatisfaction (77% of instances), alongside poor code\nquality (42% of instances) and communication issues (25% of instances). We\ndelve deeper into participants' dissatisfaction to identify six underlying\nchallenges that participants faced when using CBAs, and extracted five barriers\nto incorporating CBAs into their workflows. Finally, we surveyed 21 commercial\nCBAs to compare their capabilities with participant challenges and present\ndesign opportunities for more efficient and useful CBAs.",

      "snippet": "A surge of recent work explores the ethical and societal implications of\nlarge-scale AI models that make \"moral\" judgments. Much of this literature\nfocuses either on alignment with human judgments through various thought\nexperiments or on the group fairness implications of AI judgments. However, the\nmost immediate and likely use of AI is to help or fully replace the so-called\nstreet-level bureaucrats, the individuals deciding to allocate scarce social\nresources or approve benefits. There is a rich history underlying how\nprinciples of local justice determine how society decides on prioritization\nmechanisms in such domains. In this paper, we examine how well LLM judgments\nalign with human judgments, as well as with socially and politically determined\nvulnerability scoring systems currently used in the domain of homelessness\nresource allocation.

However, the rapid influx of state-of-the-art research,\ninconsistent data representation, and the complexity of optimizing circuit\ndesign objectives make this task significantly challenging. In this paper, we\npropose MuaLLM, an open-source multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) agent for\ncircuit design assistance that integrates a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) framework with an adaptive vector database of circuit design\nresearch papers. Unlike conventional LLMs, the MuaLLM agent employs a Reason +\nAct (ReAct) workflow for iterative reasoning, goal-setting, and multi-step\ninformation retrieval. It functions as a question-answering design assistant,\ncapable of interpreting complex queries and providing reasoned responses\ngrounded in circuit literature. Its multimodal capabilities enable processing\nof both textual and visual data, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive\nanalysis. The system dynamically adapts using intelligent search tools,\nautomated document retrieval from the internet, and real-time database updates.\nUnlike conventional approaches constrained by model context limits, MuaLLM\ndecouples retrieval from inference, enabling scalable reasoning over\narbitrarily large corpora. At the maximum context length supported by standard\nLLMs, MuaLLM remains up to 10x less costly and 1.6x faster while maintaining\nthe same accuracy. This allows rapid, no-human-in-the-loop database generation,\novercoming the bottleneck of simulation-based dataset creation for circuits.

      "snippet": "In electronic design automation, logic optimization operators play a crucial\nrole in minimizing the gate count of logic circuits. However, their computation\ndemands are high. Operators such as refactor conventionally form iterative cuts\nfor each node, striving for a more compact representation - a task which often\nfails 98% on average. Prior research has sought to mitigate computational cost\nthrough parallelization. In contrast, our approach leverages a classifier to\nprune unsuccessful cuts preemptively, thus eliminating unnecessary resynthesis\noperations. Experiments on the refactor operator using the EPFL benchmark suite\nand 10 large industrial designs demonstrate that this technique can speedup\nlogic optimization by 3.9x on average compared with the state-of-the-art ABC\nimplementation.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Uncertainty in artificial intelligence (AI) predictions poses urgent legal\nand ethical challenges for AI-assisted decision-making. We examine two\nalgorithmic interventions that act as guardrails for human-AI collaboration:\nselective abstention, which withholds high-uncertainty predictions from human\ndecision-makers, and selective friction, which delivers those predictions\ntogether with salient warnings or disclosures that slow the decision process.\nResearch has shown that selective abstention based on uncertainty can\ninadvertently exacerbate disparities and disadvantage under-represented groups\nthat disproportionately receive uncertain predictions. In this paper, we\nprovide the first integrated socio-technical and legal analysis of\nuncertainty-based algorithmic interventions. Through two case studies,\nAI-assisted consumer credit decisions and AI-assisted content moderation, we\ndemonstrate how the seemingly neutral use of uncertainty thresholds can trigger\ndiscriminatory impacts. We argue that, although both interventions pose risks\nof unlawful discrimination under UK law, selective frictions offer a promising\npathway toward fairer and more accountable AI-assisted decision-making by\npreserving transparency and encouraging more cautious human judgment.",

      "authors": "Pranav Pushkar Mishra, Mohammad Arvan, Mohan Zalake",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "We present TeamMedAgents, a novel multi-agent approach that systematically\nintegrates evidence-based teamwork components from human-human collaboration\ninto medical decision-making with large language models (LLMs). Our approach\nvalidates an organizational psychology teamwork model from human collaboration\nto computational multi-agent medical systems by operationalizing six core\nteamwork components derived from Salas et al.'s \"Big Five\" model: team\nleadership, mutual performance monitoring, team orientation, shared mental\nmodels, closed-loop communication, and mutual trust. We implement and evaluate\nthese components as modular, configurable mechanisms within an adaptive\ncollaboration architecture while assessing the effect of the number of agents\ninvolved based on the task's requirements and domain. Systematic evaluation of\ncomputational implementations of teamwork behaviors across eight medical\nbenchmarks (MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU-Pro Medical, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, MedBullets,\nPath-VQA, and PMC-VQA) demonstrates consistent improvements across 7 out of 8\nevaluated datasets. Controlled ablation studies conducted on 50 questions per\nconfiguration across 3 independent runs provide mechanistic insights into\nindividual component contributions, revealing optimal teamwork configurations\nthat vary by reasoning task complexity and domain-specific requirements. Our\nablation analyses reveal dataset-specific optimal teamwork configurations,\nindicating that different medical reasoning modalities benefit from distinct\ncollaborative patterns. TeamMedAgents represents an advancement in\ncollaborative AI by providing a systematic translation of established teamwork\ntheories from human collaboration into agentic collaboration, establishing a\nfoundation for evidence-based multi-agent system design in critical\ndecision-making domains.",
