      "authors": "Xiaohan Lan, Fanfan Liu, Haibo Qiu, Siqi Yang, Delian Ruan, Peng Shi, Lin Ma",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal\nreasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains\non intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,\ncurrent multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They\ntend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,\nleading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often\nimpairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,\nwe propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed\nto address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by\nstructuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a\nthinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking\nbranch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.\nA lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most\nsuitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into\nan MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not\nonly substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the\nmodel's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other\nreasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building\npowerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent\nreasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.",

      "snippet": "Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness\nin multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental\nlimitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and\n(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and\nconsistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement\nlearning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.\nGlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with\nreasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we\nintroduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which\nencourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a\nprogressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and\noutcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and\nout-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms\nstrong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data\nused by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM\nand F1.",

      "snippet": "Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational\nmovements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep\nlearning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the\nunderlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method\nleverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently\nusing a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A\nneural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a\nmodel-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture\nprovides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the\nblur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of\nsharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine\nresults, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving\nconsistency between the blurry input and the restored output.

However, solving this\nmixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is\ncurrently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches\nhave emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization\nto unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,\nwhich limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for\ncongestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a\ngraph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous\nedge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as\ncandidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,\nachieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves\ntransferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude\nspeed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%\noptimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as\ndrafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such\nuses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,\ncontact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private\ninformation, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with\nreal-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs\nsometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,\nleaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations\nrely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking\nreal users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the\nprivacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced\ndifferences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the\nprivacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to\nprivacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants\nusing 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical\nresponses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on\nthe privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,\nwe found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had\nlow correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the\nprivacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and\nproxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses\nin privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct\nuser-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving\nprivacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the\nalignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'\nperceived privacy and utility.",

      "snippet": "It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in\n\"mode seeking\", while optimizing forward KL results in \"mass covering\", with\nthe latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse\nmodes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does\nnot necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with\nreverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).\nInstead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal\ntarget distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode\ncoverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,\nand relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we\nshow commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal\nverifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the\noptimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these\ninsights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified\nalgorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a\ntarget distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling\nmodes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large\nLanguage Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality\nand diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both\nforward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.",

Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each\nrequiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid\ndeployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)\nOnly a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --\neliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's\nsingular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the\nfactorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple\nsubspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces\noverfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to\n24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just\n100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the\nindicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to\nfurther reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream\ntasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show\nthat combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for\ndownstream tasks.

We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free\nframework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight\ndraft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as\ndraft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization\ncandidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to\nproduce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering\ncorrect answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a\nconsensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement\nreasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on\nchallenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering\nbenchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.\nBy synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning\npaths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large\nproprietary models or training pipelines.

      "snippet": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical,\nscientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual\nreasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English\nquestions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about\ninterpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We\nsystematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the\nquestion. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond\nmeasuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the\nreasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially\nhigher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English\ngenerally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap\nincreasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy\nis susceptible to a key failure mode - getting \"Lost in Translation,\" where\ntranslation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's\nlanguage reasoning.",

      "authors": "Adarsh Vatsa, Bethel Hall, William Eiers",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Cloud computing is ubiquitous, with a growing number of services being hosted\non the cloud every day. Typical cloud compute systems allow administrators to\nwrite policies implementing access control rules which specify how access to\nprivate data is governed. These policies must be manually written, and due to\ntheir complexity can often be error prone. Moreover, existing policies often\nimplement complex access control specifications and thus can be difficult to\nprecisely analyze in determining their behavior works exactly as intended.\nRecently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success in automated\ncode synthesis and summarization. Given this success, they could potentially be\nused for automatically generating access control policies or aid in\nunderstanding existing policies. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of\nLLMs for access control policy synthesis and summarization. Specifically, we\nfirst investigate diverse LLMs for access control policy synthesis, finding\nthat: although LLMs can effectively generate syntactically correct policies,\nthey have permissiveness issues, generating policies equivalent to the given\nspecification 45.8% of the time for non-reasoning LLMs, and 93.7% of the time\nfor reasoning LLMs. We then investigate how LLMs can be used to analyze\npolicies by introducing a novel semantic-based request summarization approach\nwhich leverages LLMs to generate a precise characterization of the requests\nallowed by a policy. Our results show that while there are significant hurdles\nin leveraging LLMs for automated policy generation, LLMs show promising results\nwhen combined with symbolic approaches in analyzing existing policies.",

      "snippet": "Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a\nfixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but\ntheir finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.\nTo mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct\naccess to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and\nspace complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention\nwith token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,\nwe propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with\nsliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates\ninformation from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a\nlimited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's\nconstant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse\nattention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive\nbenchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.",
