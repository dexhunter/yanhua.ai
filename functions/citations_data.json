      "authors": "Shun Takagi, Satoshi Hasegawa",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "In cross-device private federated learning, differentially private\nfollow-the-regularized-leader (DP-FTRL) has emerged as a promising\nprivacy-preserving method. However, existing approaches assume a semi-honest\nserver and have not addressed the challenge of securely removing this\nassumption. This is due to its statefulness, which becomes particularly\nproblematic in practical settings where clients can drop out or be corrupted.\nWhile trusted execution environments (TEEs) might seem like an obvious\nsolution, a straightforward implementation can introduce forking attacks or\navailability issues due to state management. To address this problem, our paper\nintroduces a novel server extension that acts as a trusted computing base (TCB)\nto realize maliciously secure DP-FTRL. The TCB is implemented with an ephemeral\nTEE module on the server side to produce verifiable proofs of server actions.\nSome clients, upon being selected, participate in auditing these proofs with\nsmall additional communication and computational demands. This extension\nsolution reduces the size of the TCB while maintaining the system's scalability\nand liveness. We provide formal proofs based on interactive differential\nprivacy, demonstrating privacy guarantee in malicious settings. Finally, we\nexperimentally show that our framework adds small constant overhead to clients\nin several realistic settings.",

Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients\nand the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This\npaper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and\ntimeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram\n(EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive\ntemporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability\ntechniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction\nand refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and\nvalidated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls),\nemploying nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed\ntwo-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.\nInitially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner\n2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various\nstandard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.\nADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC\nsubjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and\nfrequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and\nactivation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed\nStochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding\nin interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of\nDL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.",

      "snippet": "Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have\nled to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent\nyears. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains\nprohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective,\nthe limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder\nfurther progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual\nfeatures often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each\nimaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In\nthis study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \\UOPSL that\nutilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify\npredilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our\napproach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text\ndescriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of\nunpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection\nsites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this\nmatrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space.\nDuring the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task\nbased solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we\neliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in\nfundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9\ndiverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework\noutperforms existing benchmarks.",

      "authors": "Jiaming Yan, Jianchun Liu, Hongli Xu, Liusheng Huang",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern\nlarge language models (LLMs). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU\nmemory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs.\nOffloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to\nalleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches\ntypically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch\nexperts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in\ninference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading\nlatency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system\nwith a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically\ndivided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot\nexperts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,\nthereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic\npredicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top\nsegments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is\nreduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the\nperformance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each\nlayer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a\ndivide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache\nconfiguration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that\nMoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference\nlatency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines.",

Our goals are threefold: (1) to reduce computational costs for\niterative clustering updates; (2) to enhance the impact of user-provided\nconstraints to minimize annotation requirements for precise clustering; and (3)\nto cut down memory usage in practical deployments. To achieve these aims, we\npropose a graph-based active clustering algorithm that utilizes two sparse\ngraphs: one for representing relationships between data (our proposed data\nskeleton) and another for updating this data skeleton. These two graphs work in\nconcert, enabling the refinement of connected subgraphs within the data\nskeleton to create nested clusters. Our empirical analysis confirms that the\nproposed algorithm consistently facilitates more accurate clustering with\ndramatically less input of user-provided constraints, and outperforms its\ncounterparts in terms of computational performance and scalability, while\nmaintaining robustness across various distance metrics.",

Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into\nstudent with overcoming conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we\npropose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that\nalternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and\nweight-space merging of the resulting student variants. On competition math\nbenchmarks, using only about 200 high-quality CoT samples, applying MoT to a\nQwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B,\nQWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1, demonstrating substantial gains. Besides, MoT\nconsistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation and the naive\nmulti-teacher union, raises the performance ceiling while mitigating\noverfitting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level\nteachers. Moreover, MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general\nreasoning beyond mathematics and even cultivates a better teacher, indicating\nthat consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and\nSoutheast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of\narsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically\nsignificant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited\naccess to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can\nsupport early detection and timely interventions.\n  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis\ndiagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20\nclasses and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological\nconditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were\nbenchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated\nvia LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a\nweb-based diagnostic tool.\n  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the\nSwin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM\nvisualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,\nincreasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework\nalso demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming\nits ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.\n  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep\nlearning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis\nfrom mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can\nserve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,\nwhere access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection\nand timely intervention.",

      "snippet": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often require long training to become\nuseful, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards. While\ntechniques like reward shaping and curriculum learning exist to accelerate\ntraining, these are often extremely specific and require the developer's\nprofessionalism and dedicated expertise in the problem's domain. Tackling this\nchallenge, in this study, we explore the effectiveness of pre-trained Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) as tutors in a student-teacher architecture with RL\nalgorithms, hypothesizing that LLM-generated guidance allows for faster\nconvergence. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of reusing the LLM's\nadvice on the RL's convergence dynamics. Through an extensive empirical\nexamination, which included 54 configurations, varying the RL algorithm (DQN,\nPPO, A2C), LLM tutor (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek), and environment (Blackjack,\nSnake, Connect Four), our results demonstrate that LLM tutoring significantly\naccelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance.\nFurthermore, the advice reuse mechanism shows a further improvement in training\nduration but also results in less stable convergence dynamics. Our findings\nsuggest that LLM tutoring generally improves convergence, and its effectiveness\nis sensitive to the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination.",

      "snippet": "Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such\nas surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining\nconsistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to\nviewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to\ntracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a\nunified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.\nHowever, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density\ncaused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the\nquality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking\naccuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that\ncombines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it\napplies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during\nprojection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse\nfeatures based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it\nintroduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn\ndiscriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that\nSCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%\non WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline\nmethod TrackTacular.
