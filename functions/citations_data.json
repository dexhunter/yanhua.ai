      "authors": "Hongju Su, Ke Li, Lan Yang, Honggang Zhang, Yi-Zhe Song",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Existing state-of-the-art symbolic music generation models predominantly\nadopt autoregressive or hierarchical autoregressive architectures, modelling\nsymbolic music as a sequence of attribute tokens with unidirectional temporal\ndependencies, under the assumption of a fixed, strict dependency structure\namong these attributes. However, we observe that using different attributes as\nthe initial token in these models leads to comparable performance. This\nsuggests that the attributes of a musical note are, in essence, a concurrent\nand unordered set, rather than a temporally dependent sequence. Based on this\ninsight, we introduce Amadeus, a novel symbolic music generation framework.\nAmadeus adopts a two-level architecture: an autoregressive model for note\nsequences and a bidirectional discrete diffusion model for attributes. To\nenhance performance, we propose Music Latent Space Discriminability Enhancement\nStrategy(MLSDES), incorporating contrastive learning constraints that amplify\ndiscriminability of intermediate music representations. The Conditional\nInformation Enhancement Module (CIEM) simultaneously strengthens note latent\nvector representation via attention mechanisms, enabling more precise note\ndecoding. We conduct extensive experiments on unconditional and\ntext-conditioned generation tasks. Amadeus significantly outperforms SOTA\nmodels across multiple metrics while achieving at least 4$\\times$ speed-up.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate training-free, fine-grained note attribute control\nfeasibility using our model. To explore the upper performance bound of the\nAmadeus architecture, we compile the largest open-source symbolic music dataset\nto date, AMD (Amadeus MIDI Dataset), supporting both pre-training and\nfine-tuning.",

Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial\nmanipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions\nand background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them\nparticularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in\ndetection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale\nbenchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial\ndeepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level\nmanipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of\ndetection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human\ndetection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar\nperformance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the\nrisks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume\nthat attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we\nsystematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries\nto more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task\nassistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging\nthreat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically\ntargeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation\non which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,\nRL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the\nmodel toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through\nentropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the\nescalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across\nmultiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates\nharmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.\nOur results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater\nsystemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general\ndefense.",

We present\nChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient\nmodeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive\nstrategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational\ninterviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,\nMedium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage\npipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference\noptimization (DPO).

      "snippet": "Voice-based health assessment offers unprecedented opportunities for\nscalable, non-invasive disease screening, yet existing approaches typically\nfocus on single conditions and fail to leverage the rich, multi-faceted\ninformation embedded in speech. We present MARVEL (Multi-task Acoustic\nRepresentations for Voice-based Health Analysis), a privacy-conscious multitask\nlearning framework that simultaneously detects nine distinct neurological,\nrespiratory, and voice disorders using only derived acoustic features,\neliminating the need for raw audio transmission. Our dual-branch architecture\nemploys specialized encoders with task-specific heads sharing a common acoustic\nbackbone, enabling effective cross-condition knowledge transfer. Evaluated on\nthe large-scale Bridge2AI-Voice v2.0 dataset, MARVEL achieves an overall AUROC\nof 0.78, with exceptional performance on neurological disorders (AUROC = 0.89),\nparticularly for Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment (AUROC = 0.97).\nOur framework consistently outperforms single-modal baselines by 5-19% and\nsurpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised models on 7 of 9 tasks, while\ncorrelation analysis reveals that the learned representations exhibit\nmeaningful similarities with established acoustic features, indicating that the\nmodel's internal representations are consistent with clinically recognized\nacoustic patterns. By demonstrating that a single unified model can effectively\nscreen for diverse conditions, this work establishes a foundation for\ndeployable voice-based diagnostics in resource-constrained and remote\nhealthcare settings.",

      "snippet": "Real-time human-device interaction in industrial Metaverse faces challenges\nsuch as high computational load, limited bandwidth, and strict latency. This\npaper proposes a task-oriented edge-assisted cross-system framework using\ndigital twins (DTs) to enable responsive interactions. By predicting operator\nmotions, the system supports: 1) proactive Metaverse rendering for visual\nfeedback, and 2) preemptive control of remote devices. The DTs are decoupled\ninto two virtual functions-visual display and robotic control-optimizing both\nperformance and adaptability. To enhance generalizability, we introduce the\nHuman-In-The-Loop Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (HITL-MAML) algorithm, which\ndynamically adjusts prediction horizons. Evaluation on two tasks demonstrates\nthe framework's effectiveness: in a Trajectory-Based Drawing Control task, it\nreduces weighted RMSE from 0.0712 m to 0.0101 m; in a real-time 3D scene\nrepresentation task for nuclear decommissioning, it achieves a PSNR of 22.11,\nSSIM of 0.8729, and LPIPS of 0.1298.

      "authors": "Yifan Zhang",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic\nand passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations\ncharacterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and\nvarying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and\nconvergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional\ntimetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key\ninnovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by\naugmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station\nID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,\nvelocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to\ncapture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs\ninto a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function\naligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway\ndeviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule\nadherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves\nmore stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,\n-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that\nsingle-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and\nschedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,\nreal-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to\nMARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.",

To this end, we propose CoCoL, a Communication efficient decentralized\nCollaborative Learning method tailored for multi-robot systems with\nheterogeneous local datasets. Leveraging a mirror descent framework, CoCoL\nachieves remarkable communication efficiency with approximate Newton-type\nupdates by capturing the similarity between objective functions of robots, and\nreduces computational costs through inexact sub-problem solutions. Furthermore,\nthe integration of a gradient tracking scheme ensures its robustness against\ndata heterogeneity. Experimental results on three representative multi robot\ncollaborative learning tasks show the superiority of the proposed CoCoL in\nsignificantly reducing both the number of communication rounds and total\nbandwidth consumption while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.

We then assess\nthe applicability of traditional software testing methods in each layer:\ndirectly applicable at the shell layer, requiring semantic reinterpretation at\nthe orchestration layer, and necessitating paradigm shifts at the inference\ncore. A comparative analysis of Testing AI methods from the software\nengineering community and safety analysis techniques from the AI community\nreveals structural disconnects in testing unit abstraction, evaluation metrics,\nand lifecycle management. We identify four fundamental differences that\nunderlie 6 core challenges. To address these, we propose four types of\ncollaborative strategies (\\emph{Retain}, \\emph{Translate}, \\emph{Integrate},\nand \\emph{Runtime}) and explore a closed-loop, trustworthy quality assurance\nframework that combines pre-deployment validation with runtime monitoring.\nBased on these strategies, we offer practical guidance and a protocol proposal\nto support the standardization and tooling of LLM application testing.
