      "snippet": "Training computer-use agents requires massive amounts of GUI interaction\ndata, but manually annotating action trajectories at scale is prohibitively\nexpensive. We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically\nmines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web\nscale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key\nchallenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action\nlabels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module\n(IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and\nlocalizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an\naction-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click\ncoordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube\ntutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps\nautomatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by\nsupervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success\nrates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On\nAgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%. Our results\ndemonstrate that passive internet videos can be transformed into high-quality\nsupervision for computer-use agents, providing a scalable alternative to\nexpensive manual annotation.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity\nfor their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By\nleveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs\nacquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training\nscope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their\nability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark\ndataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the\ntime-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals\nthat temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear\nmanifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods\nto derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.\nThese representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby\nfacilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve\ncompetitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while\nbeing computationally efficient.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful\ntechnique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language\nModels (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the\n''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their\ncurrent capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent\nzero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses\nthe advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible\nto the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce\nScaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive\ntraining framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a\nmodel's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses\nlearning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints,\nranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to\nconstruct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging\nmathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the\npass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative\n44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework\nprovides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to\nsolve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending\nthe frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety\ncases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety.\nThis paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on\nchain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research\nagenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and\ntrustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1)\nestablishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without\ntheir CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT\nare detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to\nmonitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three\nforms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their\npotential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining\nCoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we\nexplore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable\nCoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish\nprediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones\ninfluencing their feasibility.",

      "authors": "Hao-Chiang Shao, Chun-Hao Chang, Yu-Hsien Lin, Chia-Wen Lin, Shao-Yun Fang, Yan-Hsiu Liu",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab\nautomatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,\napplying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains\nchallenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world\nconditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result\nin data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general\npublic imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open\nimbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.\nSecond, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and\nclass-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant\ndifficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced\ndatasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14\ndataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI\nsystems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is\ncharacterized by its unique \"intra-class clusters\" property, which presents two\nmajor challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.\nThese characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,\nsignificantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers\nfor highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,\nwhich follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional\nchannel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining\nstrategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental\nevaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art\nmodels on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and\ncompetitiveness on general public datasets.",

      "authors": "Chenyu Wang, Zhanglu Yan, Zhi Zhou, Xu Chen, Weng-Fai Wong",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization\nhelps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths.\nHowever, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even\nafter quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and\ncontinue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or\nper-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement,\nincreasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient\nvalues-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current\nmatrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks\n(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the\nIntegrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and\nenergy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate\n(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively\napplies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and\nre-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed\nstorage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization\nscale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs\nenergy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while\navoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that\nSpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization\nwhile reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods,\nhighlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM\ndeployment.",

This paper contributes to\nthe emerging community vision by: (a) recommending an expansion of its scope\nbeyond code, toward a 'whole of process' vision, grounding it in SE foundations\nand evolution and emerging agentic SE frameworks, (b) proposing a preliminary\nset of values and principles to guide efforts, and (c) sharing guidance on\ndesigning/using well-defined vocabulary for agentic SE.
