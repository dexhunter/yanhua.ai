      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Effective model and hyperparameter selection remains a major challenge in\ndeep learning, often requiring extensive expertise and computation. While\nAutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based\napproaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited\ninterpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot\nhyperparameter optimization framework combining meta-learning, explainable AI,\nand efficient LLM reasoning. By leveraging historical experiment outcomes with\nSHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained\nmodels without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation\nto control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight\nmedical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that\nMetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO\nmethods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment\noutperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8\ntasks, response time reductions of 99.6-99.9%, and the fastest training times\non 6 datasets (2.4-15.7x faster), maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of\nbest-performing baselines.",

      "authors": "Ayelet Berzack, Guy Katz",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are fast becoming indispensable tools for\nsoftware developers, assisting or even partnering with them in crafting complex\nprograms. The advantages are evident -- LLMs can significantly reduce\ndevelopment time, generate well-organized and comprehensible code, and\noccasionally suggest innovative ideas that developers might not conceive on\ntheir own. However, despite their strengths, LLMs will often introduce\nsignificant errors and present incorrect code with persuasive confidence,\npotentially misleading developers into accepting flawed solutions.\n  In order to bring LLMs into the software development cycle in a more reliable\nmanner, we propose a methodology for combining them with ``traditional''\nsoftware engineering techniques in a structured way, with the goal of\nstreamlining the development process, reducing errors, and enabling users to\nverify crucial program properties with increased confidence. Specifically, we\nfocus on the Scenario-Based Programming (SBP) paradigm -- an event-driven,\nscenario-based approach for software engineering -- to allow human developers\nto pour their expert knowledge into the LLM, as well as to inspect and verify\nits outputs.\n  To evaluate our methodology, we conducted a significant case study, and used\nit to design and implement the Connect4 game. By combining LLMs and SBP we were\nable to create a highly-capable agent, which could defeat various strong\nexisting agents. Further, in some cases, we were able to formally verify the\ncorrectness of our agent. Finally, our experience reveals interesting insights\nregarding the ease-of-use of our proposed approach. The full code of our\ncase-study will be made publicly available with the final version of this\npaper.",

By analyzing social\nmedia posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate\nmisinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that\nrecently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly\nindistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the\ngeneral public.

We propose LoCoBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate long-context LLMs in\nrealistic, complex software development scenarios. Unlike existing code\nevaluation benchmarks that focus on single-function completion or short-context\ntasks, LoCoBench addresses the critical evaluation gap for long-context\ncapabilities that require understanding entire codebases, reasoning across\nmultiple files, and maintaining architectural consistency across large-scale\nsoftware systems. Our benchmark provides 8,000 evaluation scenarios\nsystematically generated across 10 programming languages, with context lengths\nspanning 10K to 1M tokens, a 100x variation that enables precise assessment of\nlong-context performance degradation in realistic software development\nsettings. LoCoBench introduces 8 task categories that capture essential\nlong-context capabilities: architectural understanding, cross-file refactoring,\nmulti-session development, bug investigation, feature implementation, code\ncomprehension, integration testing, and security analysis. Through a 5-phase\npipeline, we create diverse, high-quality scenarios that challenge LLMs to\nreason about complex codebases at unprecedented scale. We introduce a\ncomprehensive evaluation framework with 17 metrics across 4 dimensions,\nincluding 8 new evaluation metrics, combined in a LoCoBench Score (LCBS). Our\nevaluation of state-of-the-art long-context models reveals substantial\nperformance gaps, demonstrating that long-context understanding in complex\nsoftware development represents a significant unsolved challenge that demands\nmore attention.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has\nrecently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional\nsensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an \"image-relative\"\napproach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and\nsubgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have\nlimitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and\nembodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an\nembodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we\npresent a new paradigm of learning \"object-relative\" control that exhibits\nseveral desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without\nstrictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction\nproblem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high\ninvariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across\nboth training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric\nmap representation in the form of a \"relative\" 3D scene graph, which is used to\nobtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a\nlocal controller, dubbed \"ObjectReact\", conditioned directly on a high-level\n\"WayObject Costmap\" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB\ninput. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over\nits image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple\nnavigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding\ncapability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We\nfurther show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world\nindoor environments.

      "authors": "Roshan Balaji, Joe Bobby, Nirav Pravinbhai Bhatt",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Molecular property prediction using deep learning (DL) models has accelerated\ndrug and materials discovery, but the resulting DL models often lack\ninterpretability, hindering their adoption by chemists. This work proposes\ndeveloping molecule representations using the concept of Functional Groups (FG)\nin chemistry. We introduce the Functional Group Representation (FGR) framework,\na novel approach to encoding molecules based on their fundamental chemical\nsubstructures. Our method integrates two types of functional groups: those\ncurated from established chemical knowledge (FG), and those mined from a large\nmolecular corpus using sequential pattern mining (MFG). The resulting FGR\nframework encodes molecules into a lower-dimensional latent space by leveraging\npre-training on a large dataset of unlabeled molecules. Furthermore, the\nproposed framework allows the inclusion of 2D structure-based descriptors of\nmolecules. We demonstrate that the FGR framework achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on a diverse range of 33 benchmark datasets spanning physical\nchemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and\npharmacokinetics while enabling chemical interpretability. Crucially, the\nmodel's representations are intrinsically aligned with established chemical\nprinciples, allowing chemists to directly link predicted properties to specific\nfunctional groups and facilitating novel insights into structure-property\nrelationships.

      "snippet": "Controllable molecular graph generation is essential for material and drug\ndiscovery, where generated molecules must satisfy diverse property constraints.\nWhile recent advances in graph diffusion models have improved generation\nquality, their effectiveness in multi-conditional settings remains limited due\nto reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise\nfidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Composable Score-based Graph\nDiffusion model (CSGD), the first model that extends score matching to discrete\ngraphs via concrete scores, enabling flexible and principled manipulation of\nconditional guidance. Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based\ntechniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over\narbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration\n(PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test\nmismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in\ncontrollability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and\ndistributional fidelity.
