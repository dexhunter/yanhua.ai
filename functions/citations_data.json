      "title": "From Noisy Traces to Stable Gradients: Bias-Variance Optimized\n  Preference Optimization for Aligning Large Reasoning Models",
      "authors": "Mingkang Zhu, Xi Chen, Bei Yu, Hengshuang Zhao, Jiaya Jia",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) generate intermediate reasoning traces before\nproducing final answers, yielding strong gains on multi-step and mathematical\ntasks. Yet aligning LRMs with human preferences, a crucial prerequisite for\nmodel deployment, remains underexplored. The statistically correct objective\nfor preference alignment requires marginalizing over reasoning traces, but this\ncomputation is intractable in practice. A common workaround optimizes a single\nsampled trajectory, which introduces substantial gradient variance from\nstochastic trace sampling. To address this challenge, we frame preference\noptimization for LRMs through the lens of the bias--variance trade-off and\npropose Bias--Variance Optimized Preference Optimization (BVPO), a simple,\ndrop-in method that mixes two gradient estimators: a high-variance trace-based\nestimator and a low-variance empty-trace estimator obtained by disabling\nreasoning trace generation. Our theory shows that BVPO strictly reduces\ntrace-induced variance for any nontrivial mixture, provides a closed-form\nchoice of the mixing weight that minimizes mean-squared error relative to the\ntrue marginal gradient, and under standard smoothness and step-size conditions,\ntightens classical convergence bounds for stochastic gradient descent.\nEmpirically, BVPO improves alignment over the best baseline by up to 7.8 points\non AlpacaEval~2 and 6.8 points on Arena-Hard. Despite being trained only on\ngeneral conversational data, BVPO also boosts reasoning performance for base\nmodels by up to 4.0 points on the average of six math reasoning benchmarks.\nThese results identify variance from trace sampling as a key bottleneck and\ndemonstrate that directly optimizing the bias--variance trade-off yields more\nstable training and stronger overall performance.",
