      "snippet": "This study presents a machine learning framework for forecasting short-term\nfaults in industrial centrifugal pumps using real-time sensor data. The\napproach aims to predict {EarlyWarning} conditions 5, 15, and 30 minutes in\nadvance based on patterns extracted from historical operation. Two lookback\nperiods, 60 minutes and 120 minutes, were evaluated using a sliding window\napproach. For each window, statistical features including mean, standard\ndeviation, minimum, maximum, and linear trend were extracted, and class\nimbalance was addressed using the SMOTE algorithm. Random Forest and XGBoost\nclassifiers were trained and tested on the labeled dataset. Results show that\nthe Random Forest model achieved the best short-term forecasting performance\nwith a 60-minute window, reaching recall scores of 69.2\\% at 5 minutes, 64.9\\%\nat 15 minutes, and 48.6\\% at 30 minutes. With a 120-minute window, the Random\nForest model achieved 57.6\\% recall at 5 minutes, and improved predictive\naccuracy of 65.6\\% at both 15 and 30 minutes. XGBoost displayed similar but\nslightly lower performance. These findings highlight that optimal history\nlength depends on the prediction horizon, and that different fault patterns may\nevolve at different timescales. The proposed method offers an interpretable and\nscalable solution for integrating predictive maintenance into real-time\nindustrial monitoring systems.",

LLM fingerprinting, a non-intrusive technique that extracts and compares\nthe distinctive features from LLMs to identify infringements, offers a\npromising solution to copyright auditing. However, its reliability remains\nuncertain due to the prevalence of diverse model modifications and the lack of\nstandardized evaluation. In this SoK, we present the first comprehensive study\nof LLM fingerprinting. We introduce a unified framework and formal taxonomy\nthat categorizes existing methods into white-box and black-box approaches,\nproviding a structured overview of the state of the art. We further propose\nLeaFBench, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating LLM fingerprinting\nunder realistic deployment scenarios. Built upon mainstream foundation models\nand comprising 149 distinct model instances, LeaFBench integrates 13\nrepresentative post-development techniques, spanning both parameter-altering\nmethods (e.g., fine-tuning, quantization) and parameter-independent mechanisms\n(e.g., system prompts, RAG). Extensive experiments on LeaFBench reveal the\nstrengths and weaknesses of existing methods, thereby outlining future research\ndirections and critical open problems in this emerging field.

This paper presents a collection of training techniques\n- a bag of tricks - that enable robust, real-time MF detection across diverse\ndomains. We build on the efficient RTMDet single stage object detector to\nachieve high inference speed suitable for clinical deployment. Our method\naddresses scanner variability and tumor heterogeneity via extensive\nmulti-domain training data, balanced sampling, and careful augmentation.\nAdditionally, we employ targeted, hard negative mining on necrotic and debris\ntissue to reduce false positives. In a grouped 5-fold cross-validation across\nmultiple MF datasets, our model achieves an F1 score between 0.78 and 0.84. On\nthe preliminary test set of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) 2025\nchallenge, our single-stage RTMDet-S based approach reaches an F1 of 0.81,\noutperforming larger models and demonstrating adaptability to new, unfamiliar\ndomains.

Achieving this requires\nestimating crowd movement to avoid congested areas in real-time. Traditional\nmicroscopic models struggle to scale in dense crowds due to high computational\ncost, while existing macroscopic crowd prediction models tend to be either\noverly simplistic or computationally intensive. In this work, we propose a\nlightweight, real-time macroscopic crowd prediction model tailored for human\nmotion, which balances prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Our\napproach simplifies both spatial and temporal processing based on the inherent\ncharacteristics of pedestrian flow, enabling robust generalization without the\noverhead of complex architectures. We demonstrate a 3.6 times reduction in\ninference time, while improving prediction accuracy by 3.1 %. Integrated into a\nsocially aware planning framework, the model enables efficient and socially\ncompliant robot navigation in dynamic environments. This work highlights that\nefficient human crowd modeling enables robots to navigate dense environments\nwithout costly computations.",

      "snippet": "Personalized, accurate prediction of aortic aneurysm progression is essential\nfor timely intervention but remains challenging due to the need to model both\nsubtle local deformations and global anatomical changes within complex 3D\ngeometries. We propose MCMeshGAN, the first multimodal conditional mesh-to-mesh\ngenerative adversarial network for 3D aneurysm growth prediction. MCMeshGAN\nintroduces a dual-branch architecture combining a novel local KNN-based\nconvolutional network (KCN) to preserve fine-grained geometric details and a\nglobal graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture long-range structural\ncontext, overcoming the over-smoothing limitations of deep GCNs. A dedicated\ncondition branch encodes clinical attributes (age, sex) and the target time\ninterval to generate anatomically plausible, temporally controlled predictions,\nenabling retrospective and prospective modeling. We curated TAAMesh, a new\nlongitudinal thoracic aortic aneurysm mesh dataset consisting of 590 multimodal\nrecords (CT scans, 3D meshes, and clinical data) from 208 patients. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MCMeshGAN consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in both geometric accuracy and clinically important\ndiameter estimation. This framework offers a robust step toward clinically\ndeployable, personalized 3D disease trajectory modeling.

However, before\nlarge-scale deployment on public roads, extensive testing is necessary to\nvalidate their functionality and safety under diverse driving conditions.\nTherefore, different testing approaches are required, and achieving effective\nand efficient testing of ADS remains an open challenge. Recently, generative AI\nhas emerged as a powerful tool across many domains, and it is increasingly\nbeing applied to ADS testing due to its ability to interpret context, reason\nabout complex tasks, and generate diverse outputs. To gain a deeper\nunderstanding of its role in ADS testing, we systematically analyzed 91\nrelevant studies and synthesized their findings into six major application\ncategories, primarily centered on scenario-based testing of ADS. We also\nreviewed their effectiveness and compiled a wide range of datasets, simulators,\nADS, metrics, and benchmarks used for evaluation, while identifying 27\nlimitations. This survey provides an overview and practical insights into the\nuse of generative AI for testing ADS, highlights existing challenges, and\noutlines directions for future research in this rapidly evolving field.",

State-of-the-art approaches use rigid, silicon-based wearables,\nwhich, though capable of multitasking, are not optimized for lightweight,\nflexible wear, limiting their practicality for continuous monitoring. In\ncontrast, flexible electronics (FE) offer flexibility and low manufacturing\ncosts, enabling real-time stress monitoring circuits. However, implementing\ncomplex circuits like machine learning (ML) classifiers in FE is challenging\ndue to integration and power constraints. Previous research has explored\nflexible biosensors and ADCs, but classifier design for stress detection\nremains underexplored. This work presents the first comprehensive design space\nexploration of low-power, flexible stress classifiers. We cover various ML\nclassifiers, feature selection, and neural simplification algorithms, with over\n1200 flexible classifiers. To optimize hardware efficiency, fully customized\ncircuits with low-precision arithmetic are designed in each case. Our\nexploration provides insights into designing real-time stress classifiers that\noffer higher accuracy than current methods, while being low-cost, conformable,\nand ensuring low power and compact size.",

Since hardware designs and intermediate scripts can be\nrepresented as text, integrating LLM for EDA offers a promising opportunity to\nsimplify and even automate the entire workflow. Accordingly, this paper\nprovides a comprehensive overview of incorporating LLMs into EDA, with emphasis\non their capabilities, limitations, and future opportunities. Three case\nstudies, along with their outlook, are introduced to demonstrate the\ncapabilities of LLMs in hardware design, testing, and optimization.

      "authors": "Davorin Miličević, Ratko Grbić",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve high accuracy but often\nrely on purely global, gradient-based optimisation, which can lead to\noverfitting, redundant filters, and reduced interpretability. To address these\nlimitations, we propose NM-Hebb, a two-phase training framework that integrates\nneuro-inspired local plasticity with distance-aware supervision. Phase 1\nextends standard supervised training by jointly optimising a cross-entropy\nobjective with two biologically inspired mechanisms: (i) a Hebbian regulariser\nthat aligns the spatial mean of activations with the mean of the corresponding\nconvolutional filter weights, encouraging structured, reusable primitives; and\n(ii) a learnable neuromodulator that gates an elastic-weight-style\nconsolidation loss, preserving beneficial parameters without freezing the\nnetwork. Phase 2 fine-tunes the backbone with a pairwise metric-learning loss,\nexplicitly compressing intra-class distances and enlarging inter-class margins\nin the embedding space. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet\nacross five backbones (ResNet-18, VGG-11, MobileNet-v2, EfficientNet-V2,\nDenseNet-121), NM-Hebb achieves consistent gains over baseline and other\nmethods: Top-1 accuracy improves by +2.0-10.0 pp (CIFAR-10), +2.0-9.0 pp\n(CIFAR-100), and up to +4.3-8.9 pp (TinyImageNet), with Normalised Mutual\nInformation (NMI) increased by up to +0.15. Qualitative visualisations and\nfilter-level analyses further confirm that NM-Hebb produces more structured and\nselective features, yielding tighter and more interpretable class clusters.\nOverall, coupling local Hebbian plasticity with metric-based fine-tuning yields\nCNNs that are not only more accurate but also more interpretable, offering\npractical benefits for resource-constrained and safety-critical AI deployments.",
