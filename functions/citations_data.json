      "title": "Metacognitive Reuse: Turning Recurring LLM Reasoning Into Concise\n  Behaviors",
      "authors": "Aniket Didolkar, Nicolas Ballas, Sanjeev Arora, Anirudh Goyal",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large language models (LLMs) now solve multi-step problems by emitting\nextended chains of thought. During the process, they often re-derive the same\nintermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This\nsaturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study\na simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise,\nreusable \"behaviors\" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive\nanalysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a \"behavior handbook\"\nwhich supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into\nparameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved\ntest-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned\ninference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning\nreduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving\nbaseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter\nupdates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors\nfrom its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher\naccuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned\nSFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at\nconverting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla\nSFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast\nprocedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to\nconclude.",

      "authors": "Yabo Zhang, Yihan Zeng, Qingyun Li, Zhen Hu, Kavin Han, Wangmeng Zuo",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in\nlanguage understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling\nreal-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or\nspecialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement\nlearning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and\nmulti-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports\nintegration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing\nacross steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function,\ncombining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy\noptimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample\nqueue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of\ncostly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1\nsubstantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\\% gain\nover strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks.\nThese results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and\nefficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications. Our code will be\navailable at https://github.com/YBYBZhang/Tool-R1.",

      "title": "Toward PDDL Planning Copilot",
      "authors": "Yarin Benyamin, Argaman Mordoch, Shahaf S. Shperberg, Roni Stern",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents\ncapable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to\nperform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this\ngap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple\nplanning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural\nlanguage. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a\nrecently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and\nsystems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without\ndomain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning\ntasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an\nappropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and\nsimulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning\nCopilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show\nthat the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the\nplanning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool\nagainst Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our\nPlanning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much\nsmaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to\nenable LLMs to perform planning tasks.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for\nmesh-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but training them on\nhigh-resolution unstructured meshes with hundreds of thousands of nodes remains\nprohibitively expensive. We study a \\emph{coarse-to-fine curriculum} that\naccelerates convergence by first training on very coarse meshes and then\nprogressively introducing medium and high resolutions (up to \\(3\\times10^5\\)\nnodes). Unlike multiscale GNN architectures, the model itself is unchanged;\nonly the fidelity of the training data varies over time. We achieve comparable\ngeneralization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock time by up to 50\\%.\nFurthermore, on datasets where our model lacks the capacity to learn the\nunderlying physics, using curriculum learning enables it to break through\nplateaus.",

      "title": "Improving Accuracy and Efficiency of Implicit Neural Representations:\n  Making SIREN a WINNER",
      "authors": "Hemanth Chandravamsi, Dhanush V. Shenoy, Steven H. Frankel",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation\nnetworks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann\net al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting\nsignals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the\nnetwork's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral\nbottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero\noutput and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its\nrepresentational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight\nInitialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly\ninitialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are\nadaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to\nrandom Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without\nintroducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape\nfitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new\navenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep\nneural network training.
