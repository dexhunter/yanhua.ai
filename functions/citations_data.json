      "authors": "Zhiyuan He, Xufang Luo, Yike Zhang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "We propose $\\Delta L$ Normalization, a simple yet effective loss aggregation\nmethod tailored to the characteristic of dynamic generation lengths in\nReinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recently, RLVR has\ndemonstrated strong potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), but a major challenge lies in the large variability of\nresponse lengths during training, which leads to high gradient variance and\nunstable optimization. Although previous methods such as GRPO, DAPO, and Dr.\nGRPO introduce different loss normalization terms to address this issue, they\neither produce biased estimates or still suffer from high gradient variance. By\nanalyzing the effect of varying lengths on policy loss both theoretically and\nempirically, we reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased\nestimator. Our proposed $\\Delta L$ Normalization not only provides an unbiased\nestimate of the true policy loss but also minimizes gradient variance in\ntheory. Extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves superior\nresults across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks. Our code will\nbe made public at https://github.com/zerolllin/Delta-L-Normalization.",

      "authors": "Zihan Chen, Lei Shi, Weize Wu, Qiji Zhou, Yue Zhang",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Many contemporary data-driven research efforts in the natural sciences, such\nas chemistry and materials science, require large-scale, high-performance\nentity recognition from scientific datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have\nincreasingly been adopted to solve the entity recognition task, with the same\ntrend being observed on all-spectrum NLP tasks. The prevailing entity\nrecognition LLMs rely on fine-tuned technology, yet the fine-tuning process\noften incurs significant cost. To achieve a best performance-cost trade-off, we\npropose ALLabel, a three-stage framework designed to select the most\ninformative and representative samples in preparing the demonstrations for LLM\nmodeling. The annotated examples are used to construct a ground-truth retrieval\ncorpus for LLM in-context learning. By sequentially employing three distinct\nactive learning strategies, ALLabel consistently outperforms all baselines\nunder the same annotation budget across three specialized domain datasets.\nExperimental results also demonstrate that selectively annotating only 5\\%-10\\%\nof the dataset with ALLabel can achieve performance comparable to the method\nannotating the entire dataset. Further analyses and ablation studies verify the\neffectiveness and generalizability of our proposal.",

      "authors": "Songkai Ma, Zhaorui Zhang, Sheng Di, Benben Liu, Xiaodong Yu, Xiaoyi Lu, Dan Wang",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "With the widespread application of Mixture of Experts (MoE) reasoning models\nin the field of LLM learning, efficiently serving MoE models under limited GPU\nmemory constraints has emerged as a significant challenge. Offloading the\nnon-activated experts to main memory has been identified as an efficient\napproach to address such a problem, while it brings the challenges of\ntransferring the expert between the GPU memory and main memory. We need to\nexplore an efficient approach to compress the expert and analyze how the\ncompression error affects the inference performance.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose employing error-bounded lossy compression\nalgorithms (such as SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts, thereby\nreducing data transfer overhead during MoE inference. We conduct extensive\nexperiments across various benchmarks and present a comprehensive analysis of\nhow compression-induced errors in different experts affect overall inference\naccuracy. The results indicate that experts in the shallow layers, which are\nprimarily responsible for the attention mechanism and the transformation of\ninput tokens into vector representations, exhibit minimal degradation in\ninference accuracy when subjected to bounded errors. In contrast, errors in the\nmiddle-layer experts, which are central to model reasoning, significantly\nimpair inference accuracy. Interestingly, introducing bounded errors in the\ndeep-layer experts, which are mainly responsible for instruction following and\noutput integration, can sometimes lead to improvements in inference accuracy.",

      "snippet": "This paper presents an innovative Transformer-based deep learning strategy\nfor optimizing the placement of sensors aiming at structural health monitoring\nof semiconductor probe cards. Failures in probe cards, including substrate\ncracks and loosened screws, would critically affect semiconductor manufacturing\nyield and reliability. Some failure modes could be detected by equipping a\nprobe card with adequate sensors. Frequency response functions from simulated\nfailure scenarios are adopted within a finite element model of a probe card. A\ncomprehensive dataset, enriched by physics-informed scenario expansion and\nphysics-aware statistical data augmentation, is exploited to train a hybrid\nConvolutional Neural Network and Transformer model. The model achieves high\naccuracy (99.83%) in classifying the probe card health states (baseline, loose\nscrew, crack) and an excellent crack detection recall (99.73%). Model\nrobustness is confirmed through a rigorous framework of 3 repetitions of\n10-fold stratified cross-validation. The attention mechanism also pinpoints\ncritical sensor locations: an analysis of the attention weights offers\nactionable insights for designing efficient, cost-effective monitoring systems\nby optimizing sensor configurations. This research highlights the capability of\nattention-based deep learning to advance proactive maintenance, enhancing\noperational reliability and yield in semiconductor manufacturing.",

      "authors": "Mustafa Kaan Aslan, Reinout Heijungs, Filip Ilievski",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to climate change, is\na key concern for consumers, producers, and policymakers. The carbon footprint,\nbased on greenhouse gas emissions, is a standard metric for quantifying the\ncontribution to climate change of activities and is often assessed using life\ncycle assessment (LCA). However, conducting LCA is complex due to opaque and\nglobal supply chains, as well as fragmented data. This paper presents a\nmethodology that combines advances in LCA and publicly available databases with\nknowledge-augmented AI techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation, to\nestimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food products. We introduce a\nchatbot interface that allows users to interactively explore the carbon impact\nof composite meals and relate the results to familiar activities. A live web\ndemonstration showcases our proof-of-concept system with arbitrary food items\nand follow-up questions, highlighting both the potential and limitations - such\nas database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations - of delivering LCA\ninsights in an accessible format.",

The ability to identify and understand cause-effect relationships is\ncritical to making informed decisions, predicting outcomes, and developing\neffective strategies. However, deciphering causal relationships from\nobservational data is a difficult task, as correlations alone may not provide\ndefinitive evidence of causality. In recent years, the field of machine\nlearning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool, offering new opportunities for\nuncovering hidden causal mechanisms and better understanding complex systems.\nIn this work, we address the issue of detecting the intrinsic causal links of a\nlarge class of complex systems in the framework of the response theory in\nphysics. We develop some theoretical ideas put forward by [1], and technically\nwe use state-of-the-art ML techniques to build up models from data. We consider\nboth linear stochastic and non-linear systems. Finally, we compute the\nasymptotic efficiency of the linear response based causal predictor in a case\nof large scale Markov process network of linear interactions.",

The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital\nrepresentation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented\nCone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the\ngrowing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation\nmethodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited\nperformance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth\nsegmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for\npretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)\nmodalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal\ncontrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical\nfeatures, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification\nof F\\'ed\\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the\nframework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to\ndate, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive\ncollection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse\nevaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both\ninternal and external testing, with an increase of 12\\% for CBCT segmentation\nand 8\\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).\nFurthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth\ngroups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging\nconditions and clinical scenarios.",
