      "title": "MaLV-OS: Rethinking the Operating System Architecture for Machine\n  Learning in Virtualized Clouds",
      "authors": "Stella Bitchebe, Oana Balmau",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "A large body of research has employed Machine Learning (ML) models to develop\nlearned operating systems (OSes) and kernels. The latter dynamically adapts to\nthe job load and dynamically adjusts resources (CPU, IO, memory, network\nbandwidth) allocation to respond to the actual user demand. What this work has\nin common is that it utilizes ML to improve kernel decisions. To this day, and\nto the best of our knowledge, no work has taken the opposite direction, i.e.,\nusing OS to improve ML. While some work proposes applying system-level\noptimizations to ML algorithms, they do not tailor the OS to adapt to the ML\ncontext. To address this limitation, we take an orthogonal approach in this\npaper by leveraging the OS to enhance the performance of ML models and\nalgorithms. We explore the path towards an ML-specialized OS, MaLV-OS. MaLV-OS\nrethinks the OS architecture to make it specifically tailored to ML workloads,\nespecially in virtualized clouds, which are now widely used to run ML\napplications. MaLV-OS envisioned architecture includes (1) a micro-kernel,\nMicro-LAKE, which allows kernel space applications to use the GPU, and (2) an\nMLaaS (ML as a Service) subsystem that gathers ML models to help Micro-LAKE\nwith memory management and CPU scheduling. MaLV-OS architecture also offloads\nsystem-sensitive parts of the models to the OS, to lighten the model complexity\nand programming, and speed up its execution. Finally, MaLV-OS integrates an\nopen-source GPU virtualization software, merged directly into the hypervisor.\nFor more flexibility, MaLV-OS vision is to enable the virtual machine to\ndynamically select MLaaS policies that can improve the performance of the model\nthe user is running. Because MLaaS is designed as loadable kernel modules, the\nMaLV-OS architecture enables the dynamic addition of new capabilities to the\nMLaaS subsystem.",

      "authors": "Yangtian Zi, Harshitha Menon, Arjun Guha",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve high pass@1 on general\nbenchmarks like HumanEval but underperform on specialized suites such as\nParEval. Is this due to LLMs missing domain knowledge or insufficient prompt\ndetail is given? To answer this, we introduce PartialOrderEval, which augments\nany code generation benchmark with a partial order of prompts from minimal to\nmaximally detailed. Applying it to HumanEval and both serial and OpenMP subsets\nof ParEval, we measure how pass@1 scales with prompt specificity. Our\nexperiments with Llama-3.x and Qwen2.5-Coder demonstrate varying degrees of\nprompt sensitivity across different tasks, and a qualitative analysis\nhighlights explicit I/O specifications, edge-case handling, and stepwise\nbreakdowns as the key drivers of prompt detail improvement.",

      "authors": "Saleh Nikooroo, Thomas Engel",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "The internal representations learned by deep networks are often sensitive to\narchitecture-specific choices, raising questions about the stability,\nalignment, and transferability of learned structure across models. In this\npaper, we investigate how structural constraints--such as linear shaping\noperators and corrective paths--affect the compatibility of internal\nrepresentations across different architectures. Building on the insights from\nprior studies on structured transformations and convergence, we develop a\nframework for measuring and analyzing representational alignment across\nnetworks with distinct but related architectural priors. Through a combination\nof theoretical insights, empirical probes, and controlled transfer experiments,\nwe demonstrate that structural regularities induce representational geometry\nthat is more stable under architectural variation. This suggests that certain\nforms of inductive bias not only support generalization within a model, but\nalso improve the interoperability of learned features across models. We\nconclude with a discussion on the implications of representational\ntransferability for model distillation, modular learning, and the principled\ndesign of robust learning systems.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Recent advancements in large multimodal models have provided blind or\nvisually impaired (BVI) individuals with new capabilities to interpret and\nengage with the real world through interactive systems that utilize live video\nfeeds. However, the potential benefits and challenges of such capabilities to\nsupport diverse real-world assistive tasks remain unclear. In this paper, we\npresent findings from an exploratory study with eight BVI participants.\nParticipants used ChatGPT's Advanced Voice with Video, a state-of-the-art live\nvideo AI released in late 2024, in various real-world scenarios, from locating\nobjects to recognizing visual landmarks, across unfamiliar indoor and outdoor\nenvironments. Our findings indicate that current live video AI effectively\nprovides guidance and answers for static visual scenes but falls short in\ndelivering essential live descriptions required in dynamic situations. Despite\ninaccuracies in spatial and distance information, participants leveraged the\nprovided visual information to supplement their mobility strategies. Although\nthe system was perceived as human-like due to high-quality voice interactions,\nassumptions about users' visual abilities, hallucinations, generic responses,\nand a tendency towards sycophancy led to confusion, distrust, and potential\nrisks for BVI users. Based on the results, we discuss implications for\nassistive video AI agents, including incorporating additional sensing\ncapabilities for real-world use, determining appropriate intervention timing\nbeyond turn-taking interactions, and addressing ecological and safety concerns.",
