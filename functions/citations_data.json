      "authors": "Li Huang, Ilgiz Mustafin, Marco Piccioni, Alessandro Schena, Reto Weber, Bertrand Meyer",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Among areas of software engineering where AI techniques -- particularly,\nLarge Language Models -- seem poised to yield dramatic improvements, an\nattractive candidate is Automatic Program Repair (APR), the production of\nsatisfactory corrections to software bugs. Does this expectation materialize in\npractice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually\nwork? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to\ncomplement their own skills?\n  To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a\nprogram-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of\nproposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly\nassigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without,\nboth validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied\non a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric\napproach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and\nmeasurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a\nlimited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper\nrole for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs.\n  These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the\nuse of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed\nmethodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other\nprojects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible\nby the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs,\nwith 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs\nfor debugging and Automatic Program Repair.",

      "authors": "Sizhou Chen, Shufan Jiang, Chi Zhang, Xiao-Lei Zhang, Xuelong Li",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Creating an immersive and interactive theatrical experience is a long-term\ngoal in the field of interactive narrative. The emergence of large language\nmodel (LLM) is providing a new path to achieve this goal. However, existing\nLLM-based drama generation methods often result in AI agents that lack\ninitiative and cannot interact with the physical environment. Furthermore,\nthese methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These\nlimitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time\nperformance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent\nframework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple\ntopic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent\nimprovisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given\nan autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based\non their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to\nconversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of\nscene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon.\nThe change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know\nand care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the\nquality of drama performance, we designed an evaluation method to assess three\nprimary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and\ninteraction experience. The experimental evaluation shows that HAMLET can\ncreate expressive and coherent theatrical experiences. Our code, dataset and\nmodels are available at https://github.com/HAMLET-2025/HAMLET.",

      "title": "Optimal Batch-Size Control for Low-Latency Federated Learning with\n  Device Heterogeneity",
      "authors": "Huiling Yang, Zhanwei Wang, Kaibin Huang",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular approach for collaborative\nmachine learning in sixth-generation (6G) networks, primarily due to its\nprivacy-preserving capabilities. The deployment of FL algorithms is expected to\nempower a wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, e.g., autonomous\ndriving, augmented reality, and healthcare. The mission-critical and\ntime-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of\nlow-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In\npractice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of\ncomputing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the\nheterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across\ndevices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework\nfor optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency\nwhile ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental\nC$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis. Specifically,\nincreasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and\nthus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but\nresults in higher per-round latency, and vice versa. The associated problem of\nlatency minimization is intractable; however, we solve it by designing an\naccurate and tractable surrogate for convergence speed, with parameters fitted\nto real data. This approach yields two batch-size control strategies tailored\nto scenarios with slow and fast fading, while also accommodating device\nheterogeneity. Extensive experiments using real datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed strategies outperform conventional batch-size adaptation schemes that\ndo not consider the C$^2$ tradeoff or device heterogeneity.",

To address this challenge, we\npropose a proactive blockage prediction framework that utilizes multi-modal\nsensing, including camera, GPS, LiDAR, and radar inputs in an\ninfrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) setting. This approach uses modality-specific\ndeep learning models to process each sensor stream independently and fuses\ntheir outputs using a softmax-weighted ensemble strategy based on validation\nperformance. Our evaluations, for up to 1.5s in advance, show that the\ncamera-only model achieves the best standalone trade-off with an F1-score of\n97.1% and an inference time of 89.8ms.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large reasoning models have achieved remarkable performance through extended\nchain-of-thought sequences, yet this computational freedom leads to excessive\ntoken generation even for simple problems. We present Length-Adaptive Policy\nOptimization (LAPO), a novel framework that transforms reasoning length control\nfrom an external constraint into an intrinsic model capability. Unlike existing\napproaches that impose rigid limits or rely on post-hoc interventions, LAPO\nenables models to internalize an understanding of appropriate reasoning depth\nthrough a two-stage reinforcement learning process. In the first stage, models\nlearn natural reasoning patterns by discovering the statistical distribution of\nsuccessful solution lengths. The second stage leverages these patterns as\nmeta-cognitive guidance, embedding them directly within the model's reasoning\ncontext to ensure inference-time flexibility. Experiments on mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LAPO reduces token usage by up to 40.9\\%\nwhile improving accuracy by 2.3\\%. Our analysis reveals that models trained\nwith LAPO develop emergent abilities to allocate computational resources based\non problem complexity, achieving efficient reasoning without sacrificing\nquality.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Recent work has demonstrated the promise of conversational AI systems for\ndiagnostic dialogue. However, real-world assurance of patient safety means that\nproviding individual diagnoses and treatment plans is considered a regulated\nactivity by licensed professionals. Furthermore, physicians commonly oversee\nother team members in such activities, including nurse practitioners (NPs) or\nphysician assistants/associates (PAs). Inspired by this, we propose a framework\nfor effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence\nExplorer (AMIE) AI system. We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent\nsystem that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from\nindividualized medical advice. Afterwards, g-AMIE conveys assessments to an\noverseeing primary care physician (PCP) in a clinician cockpit interface. The\nPCP provides oversight and retains accountability of the clinical decision.\nThis effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen\nasynchronously. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical\nExamination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we\ncompared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across\n60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality\nintake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the\noverseeing PCP to review. This resulted in higher quality composite decisions.\nPCP oversight of g-AMIE was also more time-efficient than standalone PCP\nconsultations in prior work. While our study does not replicate existing\nclinical practices and likely underestimates clinicians' capabilities, our\nresults demonstrate the promise of asynchronous oversight as a feasible\nparadigm for diagnostic AI systems to operate under expert human oversight for\nenhancing real-world care.",

Existing VLAs struggle with complex manipulation\ntasks requiring high dexterity and generalize poorly to novel scenarios and\ntasks, primarily due to their reliance on synthetic data with significant\nsim-to-real gaps or teleoperated demonstrations lacking scale and diversity. To\naddress this data bottleneck, we propose leveraging human hands as a foundation\nmanipulator, capitalizing on the rich dexterity and scalability present in web\ndata. Our approach centers on physical instruction tuning, a novel training\nparadigm that combines large-scale VLA pretraining from human videos, physical\nspace alignment for 3D reasoning, and post-training adaptation for robotic\ntasks. Additionally, we introduce a part-level motion tokenization method which\nachieves millimeter-level reconstruction accuracy to model precise hand\ntrajectories for action learning. To support our proposed paradigm, we further\ndevelop a comprehensive data curation pipeline that integrates heterogeneous\nsources -- including motion capture, VR, and RGB-only videos -- into a\nlarge-scale dataset with millions of motion-based instructional instances. We\nempirically show the excellence of Being-H0 in hand motion generation and\ninstruction following, and it also scales well with model and data sizes.\nImportantly, we observe the expected gains of Being-H0 in real-world robotic\nmanipulation as physical instruction tuning is applied.

Current benchmarking does not, for\nexample, sufficiently reflect the diversity of anomalies in applications\nranging from predictive maintenance to scientific discovery. Consequently, we\nneed to rethink benchmarking in anomaly detection. In our opinion, anomaly\ndetection should be studied using scenarios that capture the relevant\ncharacteristics of different applications. We identify three key areas for\nimprovement: First, we need to identify anomaly detection scenarios based on a\ncommon taxonomy.
