      "authors": "Choongseok Song, Doo Seok Jeong",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Computing-In-Memory (CIM) offers a potential solution to the memory wall\nissue and can achieve high energy efficiency by minimizing data movement,\nmaking it a promising architecture for edge AI devices. Lightweight models like\nMobileNet and EfficientNet, which utilize depthwise convolution for feature\nextraction, have been developed for these devices. However, CIM macros often\nface challenges in accelerating depthwise convolution, including\nunderutilization of CIM memory and heavy buffer traffic. The latter, in\nparticular, has been overlooked despite its significant impact on latency and\nenergy consumption. To address this, we introduce a novel CIM dataflow that\nsignificantly reduces buffer traffic by maximizing data reuse and improving\nmemory utilization during depthwise convolution. The proposed dataflow is\ngrounded in solid theoretical principles, fully demonstrated in this paper.\nWhen applied to MobileNet and EfficientNet models, our dataflow reduces buffer\ntraffic by 77.4-87.0%, leading to a total reduction in data traffic energy and\nlatency by 10.1-17.9% and 15.6-27.8%, respectively, compared to the baseline\n(conventional weight-stationary dataflow).",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that require powerful models\nfor tasks like verification, diagnosis, or debugging. Often, suitable models\nare not available and manual extraction is difficult. Data-driven approaches\nthen provide a solution to, e.g., diagnosis tasks and verification problems\nbased on data collected from the system. In this paper, we consider CPS with a\ndiscrete abstraction in the form of a Mealy machine. We propose a data-driven\napproach to determine the safety probability of the system on a finite horizon\nof n time steps. The approach is based on the Probably Approximately Correct\n(PAC) learning paradigm. Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic\nand probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an\nadditional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process\nfollows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a\nguided way after an initial learning set is collected. We validate the approach\nwith a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.",

      "snippet": "The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for\nconnecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly\ngaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,\nexisting benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application\nchallenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To\naddress this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks\nthrough interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6\ncore domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository\nManagement, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web\nSearching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based\nevaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static\nevaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that\nautomatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.\nThrough extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models\nsuch as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit\nsignificant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a\nsignificant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input\ntokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it\nintroduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity\nwith the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents\nlike Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.\nBeyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI\nsupport, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new\nagents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP\necosystem.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical\napplications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major\nchallenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as\nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs\nremain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers\nappended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on\ninefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of\ncontinuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to\nselected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary\nmodels. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete\ntokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness.\nWe propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed\none-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient\ndescent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot\nencoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We\nprovide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement\nan efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs.\nOur method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to\nthree state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four\nadversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In\naddition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial\nsuffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of\noptimized suffixes to different LLMs.",
