      "authors": "Mayumi Nakano, Yuya Seki, Shuta Kikuchi, Shu Tanaka",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Black-box (BB) optimization problems aim to identify an input that minimizes\nthe output of a function (the BB function) whose input-output relationship is\nunknown. Factorization machine with annealing (FMA) is a promising approach to\nthis task, employing a factorization machine (FM) as a surrogate model to\niteratively guide the solution search via an Ising machine. Although FMA has\ndemonstrated strong optimization performance across various applications, its\nperformance often stagnates as the number of optimization iterations increases.\nOne contributing factor to this stagnation is the growing number of data points\nin the dataset used to train FM. It is hypothesized that as more data points\nare accumulated, the contribution of newly added data points becomes diluted\nwithin the entire dataset, thereby reducing their impact on improving the\nprediction accuracy of FM. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for\nsequential dataset construction that retains at most a specified number of the\nmost recently added data points. This strategy is designed to enhance the\ninfluence of newly added data points on the surrogate model. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed FMA achieves lower-cost solutions\nwith fewer BB function evaluations compared to the conventional FMA.",

      "authors": "Trevor Harris, Yan Liu",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Operator models are regression algorithms for functional data and have become\na key tool for emulating large-scale dynamical systems. Recent advances in deep\nneural operators have dramatically improved the accuracy and scalability of\noperator modeling, but lack an inherent notion of predictive uncertainty. We\nintroduce Local Spectral Conformal Inference (LSCI), a new framework for\nlocally adaptive, distribution-free uncertainty quantification for neural\noperator models. LSCI uses projection-based depth scoring and localized\nconformal inference to generate function-valued prediction sets with\nstatistical guarantees. We prove approximate finite-sample marginal coverage\nunder local exchangeability, and demonstrate significant gains in adaptivity\nand coverage across synthetic and real-world operator learning tasks.",

      "authors": "Haoyang Liu, Yijiang Li, Haohan Wang",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Gene expression analysis holds the key to many biomedical discoveries, yet\nextracting insights from raw transcriptomic data remains formidable due to the\ncomplexity of multiple large, semi-structured files and the need for extensive\ndomain expertise. Current automation approaches are often limited by either\ninflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous\nagents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry.\nGenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists\nthat integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability\nof autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through\ntyped message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a\nshared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning\nframework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action\nUnits and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack,\nthereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the\nidiosyncrasies of genomic data.\n  On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation\nof 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene\nidentification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85%\nrespectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible\ngene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting\nfor latent confounders.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "The rise of graph-structured data has driven interest in graph learning and\nsynthetic data generation. While successful in text and image domains,\nsynthetic graph generation remains challenging -- especially for real-world\ngraphs with complex, heterogeneous schemas. Existing research has focused\nmostly on homogeneous structures with simple attributes, limiting their\nusefulness and relevance for application domains requiring semantic fidelity.\n  In this research, we introduce ProvCreator, a synthetic graph framework\ndesigned for complex heterogeneous graphs with high-dimensional node and edge\nattributes. ProvCreator formulates graph synthesis as a sequence generation\ntask, enabling the use of transformer-based large language models. It features\na versatile graph-to-sequence encoder-decoder that 1. losslessly encodes graph\nstructure and attributes, 2. efficiently compresses large graphs for contextual\nmodeling, and 3. supports end-to-end, learnable graph generation.\n  To validate our research, we evaluate ProvCreator on two challenging domains:\nsystem provenance graphs in cybersecurity and knowledge graphs from\nIntelliGraph Benchmark Dataset. In both cases, ProvCreator captures intricate\ndependencies between structure and semantics, enabling the generation of\nrealistic and privacy-aware synthetic datasets.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Flow-based generative models, including diffusion models, excel at modeling\ncontinuous distributions in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we introduce\nFlow Policy Optimization (FPO), a simple on-policy reinforcement learning\nalgorithm that brings flow matching into the policy gradient framework. FPO\ncasts policy optimization as maximizing an advantage-weighted ratio computed\nfrom the conditional flow matching loss, in a manner compatible with the\npopular PPO-clip framework. It sidesteps the need for exact likelihood\ncomputation while preserving the generative capabilities of flow-based models.\nUnlike prior approaches for diffusion-based reinforcement learning that bind\ntraining to a specific sampling method, FPO is agnostic to the choice of\ndiffusion or flow integration at both training and inference time. We show that\nFPO can train diffusion-style policies from scratch in a variety of continuous\ncontrol tasks. We find that flow-based models can capture multimodal action\ndistributions and achieve higher performance than Gaussian policies,\nparticularly in under-conditioned settings.",
