      "snippet": "Time series classification (TSC) spans diverse application scenarios, yet\nlabeled data are often scarce, making task-specific training costly and\ninflexible. Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise\nin understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains\nsuboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via\nexemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into\nchannel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples\nfor each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against\nthese exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences;\na confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design\neliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by\npruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances\ninterpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine\nchallenging UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully\ntraining-free setting, surpassing multiple trained baselines. These results\ndemonstrate that a multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform\nLLMs into competitive, plug-and-play TSC solvers without any parameter\ntraining.

      "snippet": "Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability\ndespite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear\ncomplexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases,\nprohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert\npre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid\napproaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We\nidentify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the\nlinear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics\nreveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation\npractices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure\nbalanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only\nconversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining\nattention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled\nSliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax\nbranch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain\ncomputational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and\nensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of\nperformance attributions in hybrid conversions.",

      "snippet": "Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework\nfor enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),\nparticularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their\npotential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains\nunderexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing\nPRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle\nwith table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema\ninteraction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this\nlimitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)\nreasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based\nverification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design\na scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality\nstep-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with\ntool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a\ndual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use\nreasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded\nreward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly\ndesigned PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering\nnumerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves\ndownstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines\nsuch as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong\ngeneralizability across diverse TTS strategies.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Empowerment, an information-theoretic measure of an agent's potential\ninfluence on its environment, has emerged as a powerful intrinsic motivation\nand exploration framework for reinforcement learning (RL). Besides for\nunsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment\nas a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We\nshow that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient\ndownstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of\nempowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's\ncontrol over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging\nthis formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes\npolicies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a\nrobust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based\npre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its\npotential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing\npolicies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to\nimproved adaptability in downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for future\nresearch to scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks, further\nadvancing the field of RL.",

      "snippet": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range\nof natural language processing tasks and can be adapted through prompting.\nHowever, they remain suboptimal in multi-turn interactions, often relying on\nincorrect early assumptions and failing to track user goals over time, which\nmakes such tasks particularly challenging. Prior works in dialogue systems have\nshown that long-term planning is essential for handling interactive tasks. In\nthis work, we propose a prompt optimisation framework inspired by reinforcement\nlearning, which enables such planning to take place by only modifying the task\ninstruction prompt of the LLM-based agent. By generating turn-by-turn feedback\nand leveraging experience replay for prompt rewriting, our proposed method\nshows significant improvement in multi-turn tasks such as text-to-SQL and\ntask-oriented dialogue. Moreover, it generalises across different LLM-based\nagents and can leverage diverse LLMs as meta-prompting agents. This warrants\nfuture research in reinforcement learning-inspired parameter-free optimisation\nmethods.",

This work\npresents a comparative analysis of three autoencoder-based architectures:\nconvolutional autoencoder (CAE), variational autoencoder with bidirectional\nlong short-term memory (VAE-BiLSTM), and VAE-BiLSTM with multi-head attention\n(VAE-BiLSTM-MHA), for unsupervised anomaly detection in ECGs. To the best of\nour knowledge, this study reports the first application of a VAE-BiLSTM-MHA\narchitecture to ECG anomaly detection. All models are trained on normal ECG\nsamples to reconstruct non-anomalous cardiac morphology and detect deviations\nindicative of disease. Using a unified preprocessing and evaluation pipeline on\nthe public China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC) dataset, the\nattention-augmented VAE achieves the best performance, with an AUPRC of 0.81\nand a recall of 0.85 on the held-out test set, outperforming the other\narchitectures. To support clinical triage, this model is further integrated\ninto an interactive dashboard that visualizes anomaly localization.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Test-time compute can be scaled both sequentially and in parallel. Sequential\nscaling involves lengthening the generation process, while parallel scaling\ninvolves verifying and selecting among multiple candidate outputs. Combining\nthese two strategies has led to the most powerful AI systems, such as Grok 4\nHeavy and GPT-5 Pro. In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles),\nverifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This\nproperty, referred to as \\emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong\npotential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential\nand parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that\nverification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In\nexperiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget\nforcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance. Leveraging\nasymmetric verification, however, we are able to achieve substantial\nimprovements by allocating only a modest amount of compute to the verifier. We\nconduct experiments with flagship open-source models and extend them to their\n``Heavy'' variants through TTS. These deep research agents achieve gains of up\nto 27 absolute points on benchmarks such as BrowseComp. Remarkably, as an\nopen-source alternative, GLM-4.5 Heavy reaches accuracy of {\\bf 54.0\\%} on\nBrowseComp and {\\bf 66.0\\%} on GAIA, placing it comparable to the best\nproprietary choices such as OpenAI Deep Research.

      "snippet": "Reasoning models enhance performance by tackling problems in a step-by-step\nmanner, decomposing them into sub-problems and exploring long chains of thought\nbefore producing an answer. However, applying extended reasoning to every step\nintroduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty\nand complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and\ndecisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward\nrevisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow\nreasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,\nrather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,\nwe propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of\nreasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes\na mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on\nsimpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning\nshortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without\ncompromising accuracy.",

      "snippet": "Test-time scaling has emerged as a transformative paradigm for enhancing the\nperformance of large reasoning models, enabling dynamic allocation of\ncomputational resources during inference. However, as the landscape of\nreasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we\nsystematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across\ndifferent models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware\nScaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the\ntest-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing\nevaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level\nawareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased\ncomputation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling\nmechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count\ninstability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments\nevaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including\nmathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results\ndemonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of\ntest-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling\nefficiency across models.
