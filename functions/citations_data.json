      "authors": "Fulin Lin, Shaowen Chen, Ruishan Fang, Hongwei Wang, Tao Lin",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at complex tasks, their growing\nautonomy with operational complexity often leads to critical inefficiencies,\nsuch as excessive token consumption and failures arising from misinformation.\nExisting methods primarily focus on post-hoc failure attribution, lacking\nproactive, real-time interventions to enhance robustness and efficiency. To\nthis end, we introduce SupervisorAgent, a lightweight and modular framework for\nruntime, adaptive supervision that operates without altering the base agent's\narchitecture. Triggered by an LLM-free adaptive filter, SupervisorAgent\nintervenes at critical junctures to proactively correct errors, guide\ninefficient behaviors, and purify observations. On the challenging GAIA\nbenchmark, SupervisorAgent reduces the token consumption of the Smolagent\nframework by an average of 29.45% without compromising its success rate.\nExtensive experiments across five additional benchmarks (math reasoning, code\ngeneration, and question answering) and various SoTA foundation models validate\nthe broad applicability and robustness of our approach. The code is available\nat https://github.com/LINs-lab/SupervisorAgent.",

      "snippet": "Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a\nprincipled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing\nhigher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the\nhypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of\nHOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We\nextend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated\nversion of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a\nregularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong\nempirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying\ngeometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across\ndiverse learning settings.",

      "authors": "Xizhi Tian, Changjun Zhou, Yulin. Yang",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Multi-organ segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis.\nWhile recent deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in image\nsegmentation, huge variations in organ size and shape challenge their\neffectiveness in multi-organ segmentation. To address these challenges, we\npropose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel\ntwo-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation\naccuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior\nnetwork and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse\nlocalization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial\nguidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises\nfour essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric\ncross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures\nglobal semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses\non features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the\nglobal and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed\nacross all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the\nflow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the\nfinal encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and\nutilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public\ndatasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to\nexisting segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies further validate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating\nmore inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may\nalso strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same\nreasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought\nHijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful\nrequests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,\nCoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on\nGemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -\nfar exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness\nof our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers\nencode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the\nverification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting\nattention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads\nidentified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in\na safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of\nreasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined\nwith final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to\nfacilitate replication.",

Success on\nGistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate\nmodeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially\nlarge code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models\nstruggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions\ntraces.",

      "authors": "Aidan Furlong, Robert Salko, Xingang Zhao, Xu Wu",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of\napplications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely\nadopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,\nhigh-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or\ninsufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which\nleverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in\ndata-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where\npretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain\nshifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by\nlearning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under\ngreater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be\nunstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty\nquantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,\nthe staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that\ncombines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a\ndeterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature\nextractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a\nBayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for\nfine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield\ncalibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first\nvalidated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly\noutperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of\npredicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from\ntube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the\nstaged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,\npotentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.",

      "authors": "Georgios Kamaras, Craig Innes, Subramanian Ramamoorthy",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain\ndistribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment\nconditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains\nconstant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more\ndescriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to\nsuboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose\nthree heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the\nposterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated\ninto an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first\nexpose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using\nstochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic\nsupport adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic\ndeformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer\nlength and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the\nresulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy\nlearning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.",
