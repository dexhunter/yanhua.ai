      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Applying near-term variational quantum algorithms to the problem of dynamic\nsatellite network routing represents a promising direction for quantum\ncomputing. In this work, we provide a critical evaluation of two major\napproaches: static quantum optimizers such as the Variational Quantum\nEigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for\noffline route computation, and Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) methods for\nonline decision-making. Using ideal, noise-free simulations, we find that these\nalgorithms face significant challenges. Specifically, static optimizers are\nunable to solve even a classically easy 4-node shortest path problem due to the\ncomplexity of the optimization landscape. Likewise, a basic QRL agent based on\npolicy gradient methods fails to learn a useful routing strategy in a dynamic\n8-node environment and performs no better than random actions. These negative\nfindings highlight key obstacles that must be addressed before quantum\nalgorithms can offer real advantages in communication networks. We discuss the\nunderlying causes of these limitations, including barren plateaus and learning\ninstability, and suggest future research directions to overcome them.",

Prior works typically\nrely on learning latent embeddings via multimodal fusion to prompt a tunable\nSAM/SAM2 decoder for segmentation, which requires strong pixel-level\nsupervision and lacks interpretability. From a novel perspective of explicit\nreference understanding, we propose TGS-Agent, which decomposes the task into a\nThink-Ground-Segment process, mimicking the human reasoning procedure by first\nidentifying the referred object through multimodal analysis, followed by\ncoarse-grained grounding and precise segmentation. To this end, we first\npropose Ref-Thinker, a multimodal language model capable of reasoning over\ntextual, visual, and auditory cues. We construct an instruction-tuning dataset\nwith explicit object-aware think-answer chains for Ref-Thinker fine-tuning.

      "snippet": "While generalist foundation models like Gemini and GPT-4o demonstrate\nimpressive multi-modal competence, existing evaluations fail to test their\nintelligence in dynamic, interactive worlds. Static benchmarks lack agency,\nwhile interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically\nignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm,\nwe introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate,\nbut to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the\nfull sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence,\nOmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create\nscenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine\ncross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal\nmodels reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on\nhigh-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges\nrequiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this\nfragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic\nperformance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive\n\"less is more\" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically\nimprove performance.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Multimodal Recommender Systems aim to improve recommendation accuracy by\nintegrating heterogeneous content, such as images and textual metadata. While\neffective, it remains unclear whether their gains stem from true multimodal\nunderstanding or increased model complexity. This work investigates the role of\nmultimodal item embeddings, emphasizing the semantic informativeness of the\nrepresentations. Initial experiments reveal that embeddings from standard\nextractors (e.g., ResNet50, Sentence-Bert) enhance performance, but rely on\nmodality-specific encoders and ad hoc fusion strategies that lack control over\ncross-modal alignment. To overcome these limitations, we leverage Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multimodal-by-design embeddings via\nstructured prompts. This approach yields semantically aligned representations\nwithout requiring any fusion. Experiments across multiple settings show notable\nperformance improvements. Furthermore, LVLMs embeddings offer a distinctive\nadvantage: they can be decoded into structured textual descriptions, enabling\ndirect assessment of their multimodal comprehension. When such descriptions are\nincorporated as side content into recommender systems, they improve\nrecommendation performance, empirically validating the semantic depth and\nalignment encoded within LVLMs outputs. Our study highlights the importance of\nsemantically rich representations and positions LVLMs as a compelling\nfoundation for building robust and meaningful multimodal representations in\nrecommendation tasks.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Concept Erasure, which aims to prevent pretrained text-to-image models from\ngenerating content associated with semantic-harmful concepts (i.e., target\nconcepts), is getting increased attention. State-of-the-art methods formulate\nthis task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with\nsemantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update\nthe model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue\nthat existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in\nincomplete erasure due to \"non-zero alignment residual\", especially when text\nprompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality\ndegradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers.\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is\ndesigned for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall\ngenerative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict\nzero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect\nalignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete\nerasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that\ngradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from\nshallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes\ndiminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving\ngenerative quality. Empirical results across different concept erasure tasks\n(including instance, art style, and nudity erasure) have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of our ErasePro.",

      "snippet": "Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic\nheuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive\ntraps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative\nReasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from\nprobability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking \"Which\nanswer is most likely?\", DRN asks \"Which hypothesis has the most internally\nconsistent evidence?\". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly\ntracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing\nhypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our\napproach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative\nmodel that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a\nlightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs.\nEvaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to\nexpose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over\nstandard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with\nMistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most\nchallenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot\ngeneralization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional\ntraining, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable\nreasoning principles.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their\nhigh computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment.\nExisting compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g.\nlow-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered\nstructure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a\ndimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by\ndictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight\nsharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection\nmatrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's\nparameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods\nrequiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in\nAttention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers\n- and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix\natoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves\nbetter benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA),\nlow-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at\ncomparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the\ndictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing\ncross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),\nMASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks\nwith 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning\nstrategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for\nparameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we\ninvestigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce\ntheir number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their\nperformance.",

Existing PFL\nmethods typically face a significant challenge due to the ubiquitous data\nheterogeneity (i.e., non-IID data) across clients, which severely hinders\nconvergence and degrades performance. We identify that the root issue lies in\nthe long-standing reliance on gradient-based updates, which are inherently\nsensitive to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue and bridge the\nresearch gap, in this paper, we propose a Heterogeneity-invariant Personalized\nFederated learning scheme, named FedHiP, through analytical (i.e., closed-form)\nsolutions to avoid gradient-based updates. Specifically, we exploit the trend\nof self-supervised pre-training, leveraging a foundation model as a frozen\nbackbone for gradient-free feature extraction. Following the feature extractor,\nwe further develop an analytic classifier for gradient-free training. To\nsupport both collective generalization and individual personalization, our\nFedHiP scheme incorporates three phases: analytic local training, analytic\nglobal aggregation, and analytic local personalization. The closed-form\nsolutions of our FedHiP scheme enable its ideal property of heterogeneity\ninvariance, meaning that each personalized model remains identical regardless\nof how non-IID the data are distributed across all other clients.
