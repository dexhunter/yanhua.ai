      "authors": "Egor Cherepanov, Alexey K. Kovalev, Aleksandr I. Panov",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Real-world robotic agents must act under partial observability and long\nhorizons, where key cues may appear long before they affect decision making.\nHowever, most modern approaches rely solely on instantaneous information,\nwithout incorporating insights from the past. Standard recurrent or transformer\nmodels struggle with retaining and leveraging long-term dependencies: context\nwindows truncate history, while naive memory extensions fail under scale and\nsparsity. We propose ELMUR (External Layer Memory with Update/Rewrite), a\ntransformer architecture with structured external memory. Each layer maintains\nmemory embeddings, interacts with them via bidirectional cross-attention, and\nupdates them through an Least Recently Used (LRU) memory module using\nreplacement or convex blending. ELMUR extends effective horizons up to 100,000\ntimes beyond the attention window and achieves a 100% success rate on a\nsynthetic T-Maze task with corridors up to one million steps. In POPGym, it\noutperforms baselines on more than half of the tasks. On MIKASA-Robo\nsparse-reward manipulation tasks with visual observations, it nearly doubles\nthe performance of strong baselines. These results demonstrate that structured,\nlayer-local external memory offers a simple and scalable approach to decision\nmaking under partial observability.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Nuclear fusion plays a pivotal role in the quest for reliable and sustainable\nenergy production. A major roadblock to viable fusion power is understanding\nplasma turbulence, which significantly impairs plasma confinement, and is vital\nfor next-generation reactor design. Plasma turbulence is governed by the\nnonlinear gyrokinetic equation, which evolves a 5D distribution function over\ntime. Due to its high computational cost, reduced-order models are often\nemployed in practice to approximate turbulent transport of energy. However,\nthey omit nonlinear effects unique to the full 5D dynamics. To tackle this, we\nintroduce GyroSwin, the first scalable 5D neural surrogate that can model 5D\nnonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, thereby capturing the physical phenomena\nneglected by reduced models, while providing accurate estimates of turbulent\nheat transport.GyroSwin (i) extends hierarchical Vision Transformers to 5D,\n(ii) introduces cross-attention and integration modules for latent\n3D$\\leftrightarrow$5D interactions between electrostatic potential fields and\nthe distribution function, and (iii) performs channelwise mode separation\ninspired by nonlinear physics. We demonstrate that GyroSwin outperforms widely\nused reduced numerics on heat flux prediction, captures the turbulent energy\ncascade, and reduces the cost of fully resolved nonlinear gyrokinetics by three\norders of magnitude while remaining physically verifiable. GyroSwin shows\npromising scaling laws, tested up to one billion parameters, paving the way for\nscalable neural surrogates for gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Math word problems (MWPs) are critical K-12 educational tools, and\ncustomizing them to students' interests and ability levels can increase\nlearning outcomes. However, teachers struggle to find time to customize MWPs\nfor each student given large class sizes and increasing burnout. We propose\nthat LLMs can support math education by generating MWPs customized to student\ninterests and math education standards. To this end, we use a joint human\nexpert-LLM judge approach to evaluate over 11,000 MWPs generated by open and\nclosed LLMs and develop the first teacher-annotated dataset for\nstandards-aligned educational MWP generation. We show the value of our data by\nusing it to train a 12B open model that matches the performance of larger and\nmore capable open models. We also use our teacher-annotated data to train a\ntext classifier that enables a 30B open LLM to outperform existing closed\nbaselines without any training. Next, we show our models' MWPs are more similar\nto human-written MWPs than those from existing models. We conclude by\nconducting the first study of customized LLM-generated MWPs with grade school\nstudents, finding they perform similarly on our models' MWPs relative to\nhuman-written MWPs but consistently prefer our customized MWPs.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Post-training for reasoning of large language models (LLMs) increasingly\nrelies on verifiable rewards: deterministic checkers that provide 0-1\ncorrectness signals. While reliable, such binary feedback is brittle--many\ntasks admit partially correct or alternative answers that verifiers\nunder-credit, and the resulting all-or-nothing supervision limits learning.\nReward models offer richer, continuous feedback, which can serve as a\ncomplementary supervisory signal to verifiers. We introduce HERO (Hybrid\nEnsemble Reward Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that\nintegrates verifier signals with reward-model scores in a structured way. HERO\nemploys stratified normalization to bound reward-model scores within\nverifier-defined groups, preserving correctness while refining quality\ndistinctions, and variance-aware weighting to emphasize challenging prompts\nwhere dense signals matter most. Across diverse mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks, HERO consistently outperforms RM-only and verifier-only baselines,\nwith strong gains on both verifiable and hard-to-verify tasks. Our results show\nthat hybrid reward design retains the stability of verifiers while leveraging\nthe nuance of reward models to advance reasoning.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Molecular graph representation learning is widely used in chemical and\nbiomedical research. While pre-trained 2D graph encoders have demonstrated\nstrong performance, they overlook the rich molecular domain knowledge\nassociated with submolecular instances (atoms and bonds). While molecular\npre-training approaches incorporate such knowledge into their pre-training\nobjectives, they typically employ designs tailored to a specific type of\nknowledge, lacking the flexibility to integrate diverse knowledge present in\nmolecules. Hence, reusing widely available and well-validated pre-trained 2D\nencoders, while incorporating molecular domain knowledge during downstream\nadaptation, offers a more practical alternative. In this work, we propose\nMolGA, which adapts pre-trained 2D graph encoders to downstream molecular\napplications by flexibly incorporating diverse molecular domain knowledge.\nFirst, we propose a molecular alignment strategy that bridge the gap between\npre-trained topological representations with domain-knowledge representations.\nSecond, we introduce a conditional adaptation mechanism that generates\ninstance-specific tokens to enable fine-grained integration of molecular domain\nknowledge for downstream tasks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on\neleven public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of MolGA.",

State-of-the-art approaches,\nparticularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance\ndetection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object\nqueries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the\ninherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose\n\\textbf{MapGR} (\\textbf{G}lobal \\textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD\n\\textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a\nglobal representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic\nmodules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the\ndistribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a\ncarefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation\nGuidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit,\nglobal-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization.

The behavior of RL agents is shaped by the training\nscenarios they encounter, but creating scenarios that capture the complexity of\nmaritime navigation is non-trivial, and real-world data alone is insufficient.\nTo address this, we propose a falsification-driven RL approach that generates\nadversarial training scenarios in which the vessel under test violates maritime\ntraffic rules, which are expressed as signal temporal logic specifications. Our\nexperiments on open-sea navigation with two vessels demonstrate that the\nproposed approach provides more relevant training scenarios and achieves more\nconsistent rule compliance.",

      "snippet": "Conformal prediction provides prediction sets with coverage guarantees. The\ninformativeness of conformal prediction depends on its efficiency, typically\nquantified by the expected size of the prediction set. Prior work on the\nefficiency of conformalized regression commonly treats the miscoverage level\n$\\alpha$ as a fixed constant. In this work, we establish non-asymptotic bounds\non the deviation of the prediction set length from the oracle interval length\nfor conformalized quantile and median regression trained via SGD, under mild\nassumptions on the data distribution. Our bounds of order\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{n} + 1/(\\alpha^2 n) + 1/\\sqrt{m} + \\exp(-\\alpha^2 m))$\ncapture the joint dependence of efficiency on the proper training set size $n$,\nthe calibration set size $m$, and the miscoverage level $\\alpha$. The results\nidentify phase transitions in convergence rates across different regimes of\n$\\alpha$, offering guidance for allocating data to control excess prediction\nset length.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Large language models are emerging as powerful tools for scientific law\ndiscovery, a foundational challenge in AI-driven science. However, existing\nbenchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma,\nforcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance\nto memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function\nfitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering\nembedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To\naddress these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising\n324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design\nmitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic\nalterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are\nscalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we\nelevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model\ndiscovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems\nto uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but\nfragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades\nprecipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme\nsensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of\ntool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by\ninducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to\nsatisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust,\ngeneralizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core\nchallenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic\ntestbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and\nguiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine\nscientific discovery.",

      "snippet": "Physical vulnerability and mortality are often seen as obstacles to be\navoided in the development of artificial agents, which struggle to adapt to\nopen-ended environments and provide aligned care. Meanwhile, biological\norganisms survive, thrive, and care for each other in an open-ended physical\nworld with relative ease and efficiency. Understanding the role of the\nconditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,\nadaptive, and caring artificial agents. Here we define two minimal conditions\nfor physical embodiment inspired by the existentialist phenomenology of Martin\nHeidegger: being-in-the-world (the agent is a part of the environment) and\nbeing-towards-death (unless counteracted, the agent drifts toward terminal\nstates due to the second law of thermodynamics). We propose that from these\nconditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining\nintegrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an\nintrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing\ninspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power,\nwe examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g.,\nempowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to\nmeet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to\nmaintain physical integrity. We formalize these concepts within a reinforcement\nlearning framework, which enables us to examine how intrinsically driven\nembodied agents learning in open-ended multi-agent environments may cultivate\nthe capacities for open-endedness and care.ov",

Inspired by the\nMulti-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce a memory framework of\nartificial neural networks. Our method maintains a sliding window of the\nTransformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable module\ntermed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses\nout-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. To\nvalidate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like\narchitectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and Gated DeltaNet. Extensive\nexperiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate\nthat AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and\nachieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while\nsubstantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance,\naugmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5%\nand memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128k\nsequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88.

Radio maps provide a\npromising solution for radio resource management by reducing online CSI\nacquisition. However, conventional approaches for radio map construction\nrequire location-labeled CSI data, which is challenging in practice. This paper\ninvestigates unsupervised angular power map construction based on large\ntimescale CSI data collected in a massive MIMO network without location labels.\nA hidden Markov model (HMM) is built to connect the hidden trajectory of a\nmobile with the CSI evolution of a massive MIMO channel. As a result, the\nmobile location can be estimated, enabling the construction of an angular power\nmap. We show that under uniform rectilinear mobility with Poisson-distributed\nbase stations (BSs), the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for localization error\ncan vanish at any signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), whereas when BSs are confined\nto a limited region, the error remains nonzero even with infinite independent\nmeasurements. Based on reference signal received power (RSRP) data collected in\na real multi-cell massive MIMO network, an average localization error of 18\nmeters can be achieved although measurements are mainly obtained from a single\nserving cell.",
