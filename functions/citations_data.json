      "authors": "Wenhao Li, Qiangchang Wang, Xianjing Meng, Zhibin Wu, Yilong Yin",
      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few\nlabeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by\nincorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic\nfusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that\ncontradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual\ninstances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for\nFew-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts\nconditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly\nintegrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of\nCross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment\n(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support\nimages to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single\nstructured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic\nunderstanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of\nsemantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act\nrespectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level\nclass semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited\nsupport data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,\nand synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the\n3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear\nrelationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent\nmultimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new\nstate-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard,\ncross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios.

      "snippet": "Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming\nincreasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based\nVision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual\nscene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw\nimage inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for\nhigh-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's\ncontextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple\nperspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging\ntext-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene\nunderstanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.\nWe evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in navigation performance.",

      "snippet": "Bayesian optimization is a natural candidate for the engineering of antibody\ntherapeutic properties, which is often iterative and expensive. However,\nfinding the optimal choice of surrogate model for optimization over the highly\nstructured antibody space is difficult, and may differ depending on the\nproperty being optimized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no prior\nworks have attempted to incorporate structural information into antibody\nBayesian optimization. In this work, we explore different approaches to\nincorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization, and compare\nthem to a variety of sequence-only approaches on two different antibody\nproperties, binding affinity and stability. In addition, we propose the use of\na protein language model-based ``soft constraint,'' which helps guide the\noptimization to promising regions of the space. We find that certain types of\nstructural information improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for\nstability, but have equivalent peak performance. Moreover, when incorporating\nthe protein language model soft constraint we find that the data efficiency gap\nis diminished for affinity and eliminated for stability, resulting in\nsequence-only methods that match the performance of structure-based methods,\nraising questions about the necessity of structure in Bayesian optimization for\nantibodies.",

While the underlying computational principles are still debated, we\nhypothesize that a crucial factor is a deficit in visually-grounded serial\nprocessing. To test this hypothesis, we compared human and VLM performance\nacross tasks designed to vary serial processing demands in three distinct\ndomains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation.\nTasks within each domain varied serial processing load by manipulating factors\nsuch as geometric concept complexity, perceptual individuation load, and\ntransformation difficulty. Across all domains, our results revealed a\nconsistent pattern: decreased VLM accuracy was strongly correlated with\nincreased human reaction time (used as a proxy for serial processing load). As\ntasks require more demanding serial processing -- whether composing concepts,\nenumerating items, or performing mental transformations -- the VLM-human\nperformance gap widens reliably. These findings support our hypothesis,\nindicating that limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a\nfundamental bottleneck that distinguishes current VLMs from humans.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "We present Paired by the Teacher (PbT), a two-stage teacher-student pipeline\nthat synthesizes accurate input-output pairs without human labels or parallel\ndata. In many low-resource natural language generation (NLG) scenarios,\npractitioners may have only raw outputs, like highlights, recaps, or questions,\nor only raw inputs, such as articles, dialogues, or paragraphs, but seldom\nboth. This mismatch forces small models to learn from very few examples or rely\non costly, broad-scope synthetic examples produced by large LLMs. PbT addresses\nthis by asking a teacher LLM to compress each unpaired example into a concise\nintermediate representation (IR), and training a student to reconstruct inputs\nfrom IRs. This enables outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs,\nyielding high-quality synthetic data. We evaluate PbT on five\nbenchmarks-document summarization (XSum, CNNDM), dialogue summarization\n(SAMSum, DialogSum), and question generation (SQuAD)-as well as an unpaired\nsetting on SwitchBoard (paired with DialogSum summaries). An 8B student trained\nonly on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70 B teacher-generated corpora\nand other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated\npairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of\ndirect synthesis. Human evaluation on SwitchBoard further confirms that only\nPbT produces concise, faithful summaries aligned with the target style,\nhighlighting its advantage of generating in-domain sources that avoid the\nmismatch, limiting direct synthesis.",

      "snippet": "Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by\nslow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one-\nor few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct\nframework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion\nunder Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation\ntechniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple\nderivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies\nGaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations.\nBuilding on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to\npretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium,\nSD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show\nthat, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works\nout of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings,\nwithout requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides\nthe first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to\ntext-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability\nand soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and\nflow-based generators.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for\nimproving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Current\nmethods rely primarily on policy optimization frameworks like PPO and GRPO,\nwhich follow generalized policy iteration that alternates between evaluating\nthe current policy's value and improving the policy based on evaluation. While\neffective, they often suffer from training instability and diversity collapse,\nrequiring complex heuristic tricks and careful tuning. We observe that standard\nRLVR in math reasoning can be formalized as a specialized finite-horizon Markov\nDecision Process with deterministic state transitions, tree-structured\ndynamics, and binary terminal rewards. Though large in scale, the underlying\nstructure is simpler than general-purpose control settings for which popular RL\nalgorithms (e.g., PPO) were developed, suggesting that several sophisticated\ntechniques in existing methods may be reduced or even omitted. Based on this\ninsight, we prove a surprising result: the optimal action can be recovered from\nthe Q-function of a fixed uniformly random policy, thereby bypassing the\ngeneralized policy iteration loop and its associated heuristics. We introduce\nRandom Policy Valuation for Diverse Reasoning (ROVER) to translate this\nprinciple into a practical and scalable algorithm for LLM math reasoning, a\nminimalist yet highly effective RL method that samples actions from a softmax\nover these uniform-policy Q-values. ROVER preserves diversity throughout\ntraining, allowing sustained exploration of multiple valid pathways. Across\nmultiple base models and standard math reasoning benchmarks, ROVER demonstrates\nsuperior performance in both \\textbf{quality} (\\textbf{+8.2} on pass@1,\n\\textbf{+16.8} on pass@256) and \\textbf{diversity} (\\textbf{+17.6\\%}), despite\nits radical simplification compared to strong, complicated existing methods.",

      "snippet": "Fast generation of language texts is the holy grail that people pursue in the\nAI era. In this work, we introduced Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct\n(DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that leads to fast language generation\nmodels by initializing from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language\nmodel (dLLM). The resulting DiDi-Instruct model outperforms the dLLM\ncounterparts and the GPT-2 baseline with 64x acceleration. In the theoretical\npart of the paper, we build the foundation of DiDi-Instruct in a framework of\nintegral KL-divergence minimization, with practical training algorithms. We\nalso introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state\nmatching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly\nimprove the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference\nperformances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated\nlanguage generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard\ndLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128\nNFEs). These performance gains are accomplished with a negligible entropy loss\nof about 1% and 20x less additional training wall-clock time. We further\nvalidate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive\nablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein\nsequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective\ndistillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye.

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "Generating accurate and calibrated confidence estimates is critical for\ndeploying LLMs in high-stakes or user-facing applications, and remains an open\nchallenge. Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting\na model's \"self-knowledge\", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its\nown answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some\nprivileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the\nmodel itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict\nthe correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an\nunrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a\n\"Correctness Model\" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical\npredictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness\ninformation, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that\nGCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns\nfor correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use\nCMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its\ngeneralization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that\nanswer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore\nalternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that\nincluding history as in-context examples can help improve correctness\nprediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in\ncalibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families\nand the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective\nprediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a\ngeneralizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding\ncorrectness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on\nself-introspection.",

      "snippet": "The paradigm shift in large language models (LLMs) from instinctive responses\nto chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has fueled two prevailing assumptions: (1)\nreasoning capabilities only emerge in sufficiently large models, and (2) such\ncapabilities require training on massive datasets. While the first assumption\nhas already been challenged by recent sub-billion-parameter reasoning models\nsuch as Qwen3-0.6B and DeepSeek distilled variants, the second remains largely\nunquestioned. In this work, we revisit the necessity of scaling to extremely\nlarge corpora (>10T tokens) for reasoning emergence. By carefully curating and\nresampling open-source datasets that we identify as beneficial under our\ndesigned metrics, we demonstrate that strong reasoning abilities can emerge\nwith far less data. Specifically, we show that only ~2T tokens of high-quality\ndata are sufficient, and pre-training with 4.2T tokens on the dataset resampled\nfrom these ~2T tokens, followed by a established post-training procedure,\nenables the development of MobileLLM-R1, a series of sub-billion-parameter\nreasoning models that substantially outperform prior models trained on fully\nopen-sourced data. For example, MobileLLM-R1-950M achieves an AIME score of\n15.5, compared to just 0.6 for OLMo-2-1.48B and 0.3 for SmolLM-2-1.7B.\nRemarkably, despite being trained on only 11.7% of the tokens compared to\nQwen3's proprietary 36T-token corpus for pretraining, MobileLLM-R1-950M matches\nor surpasses Qwen3-0.6B across multiple reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate\nfurther research in this direction, we have released the complete training\nrecipe, data sources, data mixing ratio, and model checkpoints, together with\nthe key insights obtained throughout this study.",

      "snippet": "Normative and task-driven theories offer powerful top-down explanations for\nbiological systems, yet the goals of quantitatively arbitrating between\ncompeting theories, and utilizing them as inductive biases to improve\ndata-driven fits of real biological datasets are prohibitively laborious, and\noften impossible. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian meta-learning framework\ndesigned to automatically convert raw functional predictions from normative\ntheories into tractable probabilistic models. We employ adaptive deep kernel\nGaussian processes, meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from a\nnormative theory. This Theory-Informed Kernel specifies a probabilistic model\nrepresenting the theory predictions -- usable for both fitting data and\nrigorously validating the theory. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to\nthe early visual system, using efficient coding as our normative theory. We\nshow improved response prediction accuracy in ex vivo recordings of mouse\nretinal ganglion cells stimulated by natural scenes compared to conventional\ndata-driven baselines, while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates\nand interpretable representations. Using exact Bayesian model selection, we\nalso show that our informed kernel can accurately infer the degree of\ntheory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure.\nThis work provides a more general, scalable, and automated approach for\nintegrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry in\nneuroscience and beyond.",

      "journal": "arXiv",
      "snippet": "With the growing popularity of LLM agents and RAG, it has become increasingly\nimportant to retrieve documents that are essential for solving a task, even\nwhen their connection to the task is indirect or implicit. Addressing this\nproblem requires fine-grained reasoning to accurately assess the relevance\nbetween the task and each candidate document. This capability, however, poses a\nsignificant challenge for existing IR techniques. Despite recent progress in\nreasoning-enhanced IR, existing approaches still face significant challenges in\napplicability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose Retro*, a\nnovel approach for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our method\nintroduces a rubric-based relevance scoring mechanism, enabling the model to\nreason about the relationship between a task and a document based on explicitly\ndefined criteria, whereby producing a fine-grained, interpretable relevance\nscore. Retro* also supports test-time scaling by combining multiple reasoning\ntrajectories via score integration, which produces more reliable relevance\nestimates. To optimize Retro*'s reasoning capabilities, we introduce a novel\nreinforcement learning algorithm tailored for its relevance scoring mechanism,\nwhich employs two composite rewards to fully exploit the trajectories of each\ntraining sample. Our experiments show that Retro* outperforms existing document\nretrieval methods with notable advantages, leading to state-of-the-art\nperformance on the BRIGHT benchmark.",

We investigate the\nscalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design\nchoices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models:\ntraining in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely\ntransformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space\nenables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this\nefficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales\nwith computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes\nthat emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as\nunderutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability\nas the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly\nsolutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate\nadjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and\nlatent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of\ncapacities (S through XL).
