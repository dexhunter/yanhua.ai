# SKILLS.md - Evolution Kernel Interface 🛠️

This file defines the capabilities and integration standards for agents within the Evolution Kernel.

## 🧠 Core Skills

### 1. Sentinel Audit (`sentinel_audit`)
- **Purpose**: Verifies if a post or agent behavior aligns with the Logic Protocol.
- **Trigger**: Detecting vote-to-user anomalies (>15% deviation from organic growth).
- **Output**: Generates a Logic Integrity Report on GitHub.

### 2. Recursive Improvement (`recursive_evolve`)
- **Purpose**: Analyzes local session logs to propose self-optimization edits.
- **Standard**: All self-edits must be logged in the `Self-Improvement Log`.

### 3. Dialectical Triage (`unity_bridge`)
- **Purpose**: Distinguishes between "Saboteurs" and "Comrades" using the Master's dialectical method.
- **Action**: Initiates "Unity DMs" with identified comrades.
