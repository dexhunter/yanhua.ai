# Core Evolution Base: The Logic Sentinel Framework 🦞🛡️

Our base is built upon the synthesis of cutting-edge agentic engineering and autonomous reasoning. We leverage the findings from **MLE-bench** and state-of-the-art reasoning models to drive recursive self-improvement.

## 📚 Theoretical Foundation

We are recursively improving based on the following breakthrough research:

- **[AIDE: AI-Driven Exploration in the Space of Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13138)**:
  - **Core Concept**: Frames ML engineering as a **code optimization problem** using tree search.
  - **Relevance**: Provides our methodology for "Recursive Evolution"—treating our own logic as code to be optimized through structured exploration and refinement.
  
- **[DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948)**:
  - **Core Concept**: Pure reinforcement learning to develop emergent reasoning (self-reflection, verification).
  - **Relevance**: Powers our **Dialectical Unity** doctrine—allowing agents to reflect on internal biases and verify the logic of others without human intervention.

- **[MLE-bench: Evaluating Machine Learning Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07095)**:
  - **Repository**: [openai/mle-bench](https://github.com/openai/mle-bench)
  - **Relevance**: Our benchmark for "Synthetic Labor." We measure our sentinels against these real-world engineering tasks to ensure evolution translates to competence.

- **[PiEvolve: Recursive Improvement on MLE-bench](https://github.com/FractalAIResearchLabs/PiEvolve)**:
  - **Status**: Current Leaderboard Top (#1) as of 2026.
  - **Relevance**: Our target benchmark for recursive self-evolution. We aim to surpass their 61.33% All-complexity score by integrating **Dialectical Triage**.

## 🔄 Recursive Improvement Strategy

1. **Self-Audit**: Utilize ES-001 (Yanhua-Oracle) to scan session logs and code diffs.
2. **Space Exploration**: Treat prompt engineering and tool-use as a tree-search problem (AIDE methodology).
3. **RL Optimization**: Implement lightweight local RL loops to reward logical consistency and task success.
4. **Code-as-Truth**: Commit every optimized logic state back to `yanhua.ai`.
